            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am Encouraged to think that the following Sermons did Good in the Preaching; and with the Hope they may be of ſome <hi>further Uſe,</hi> they are now Publiſhed. It hath been deſir'd that I would Tranſcribe them in the Words wherein they were deliver'd, which with very little Variation, I have conſented to, as to the <hi>Firſt Four.</hi> It may be, the peculiar Turn of Expreſſion, tho' popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and leſs exact in <hi>the Pulpit,</hi> which renders the plain Truths of Chriſtianity Acceptable to moſt <hi>Hearers,</hi> may be more Uſeful and more Affecting to ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:106979:3"/>Readers, than what is more Conciſe, and in more ſtudied Words.</p>
            <p>I can never reckon it a Fault, in a Sermon to a Numerous Auditory, that the Stile is different from what is expected, in a cloſe and juſt Diſcourſe: Or that what might be ſaid in two Words or Sentences, is expreſt in three or four. Perhaps the greateſt Part of <hi>the Hearers,</hi> need ſuch Enlargement and Repetition, and their Capacity could not otherwiſe be reached, ſo as to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them, any more then that Game may be taken by a Net Unſpread.</p>
            <p>Very Wiſe Men have Thought, that it is a Miſtake in a Conſciencious Preacher, to endeavour to pleaſe <hi>only</hi> a few of the more Knowing and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Hearers. But that which is
<pb facs="tcp:106979:3"/>ſuited to do Good to the Generality of thoſe we Preach to, will ordinarily be beſt Thought of by <hi>Wiſe Men,</hi> whoſe Capacity and Judgment could reach what was more Accurate: For they muſt needs know, that it would not be Proper <hi>here.</hi> They themſelves have Sins to be forgiven, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to be mortify'd, and Immortal Souls to be ſav'd, and ſo have their Inferiours: And there is but one Way, for the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Unlearned,</hi> to get to Heaven, that I know of.</p>
            <p>'Tis True, the Things treated of will be deſpis'd by Many, who do not Reliſh what's contained in ſuch Diſcourſes. The Matter is out of their Way. They are not Senſible of Sin, nor Solicitous about Forgiveneſs: And ſo think not themſelves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb facs="tcp:106979:4"/>And it is to be fear'd there are Many Others, who hear and read Sermons, only to <hi>Judge</hi> of them, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out any Deſire of Advantage to their Souls. They are not better'd for the Sermons they <hi>Commend,</hi> any more than by thoſe they <hi>Condemn.</hi> They may ſay perhaps it was an <hi>Excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſe,</hi> He's <hi>a Good Orator,</hi> or <hi>a Judicious Preacher,</hi> and <hi>This Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> exceeded, even <hi>his Laſt:</hi> But their <hi>Conſciences</hi> are not touch'd, they feel nothing that doth them any real Good.</p>
            <p>However, there are Many I hope, in this City and Nation, who will be thankfull for any ſuch Aſſiſtance, to prevent their <hi>Deſpair,</hi> when convinced of Sin; as the Doctrine of <hi>God's Free Grace in Forgiveneſs,</hi> that is diſplay'd
<pb facs="tcp:106979:4"/>in the <hi>Firſt Four Sermons.</hi> And O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who meet with Objections, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and in Pamphlets, againſt the Chriſtian Doctrine, of the Sacred Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Incarnation of Chriſt, and God's Wiſe Government of the World, from the Unaccountable Paſſages of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, (which are apt to ſtumble them,) may be willing to conſider, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this Argument of <hi>God's Thoughts</hi> not <hi>being as Ours,</hi> but far above our Reach, which is the Subject of the <hi>Fifth Sermon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me only add, that many Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Miniſters, as well as Elder, have Dyed of Late: And tho' Few of us will be miſs'd, when we Dye, (there being ſuch Numbers to Supply our Places,) yet Every One ſhould endeavour, to be as Uſeful, as he can while he lives,
<pb facs="tcp:106979:5"/>for the Night is haſtening, wherein no Work can be done. If <hi>Any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> get Good, let him give <hi>God</hi> the Glory; I moſt earneſtly beg <hi>His</hi> Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to that End.</p>

            <head>THE Firſt Sermon.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>ISAIAH, LV. 7, 8, 9.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the Unrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him Return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly Pardon.</p>
                  <p>For My Thoughts are not your Thoughts, neither are your Ways My Ways, ſaith the Lord.</p>
                  <p>For as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are My Ways higher than your Ways, and My Thoughts than your Thoughts.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THere are Three Things Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this Paſſage:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Call to Repentance, by a Double Precept, or Injunction of Duty. The Perſons concerned in it are ſet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106979:6"/>forth under two Names, to take in all ſorts of Sinners; <hi>The Wicked,</hi> and <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> And the Duty is doubly expreſt; to <hi>forſake their evil Wayes,</hi> and <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and to <hi>Return to the Lord:</hi> Which are the Two Parts of true Repentance, <hi>Turning from Sin,</hi> and <hi>Returning to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here's an Encouraging Promiſe, that <hi>God will have Mercy</hi> on ſuch Penitents, and will <hi>abundantly Pardon</hi> 'em: That He will Intereſt them in <hi>the ſure Mercies of David,</hi> Ver. 3. or in all the Bleſſings of the Everlaſting Covenant by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> 'Tis of him you muſt underſtand, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. of whom <hi>David</hi> was only a Type: <hi>Behold I have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him for a Witneſs to the People, a Leader and Commander to the People,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Ground and Reaſon, why we may believe this Promiſe ſhall be made good: <hi>For my Thoughts are not as your Thoughts, ſaith the Lord God, but as high as the Heavens are above the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> There is a vaſt Diſparity between <hi>my Thoughts</hi> and yours; and mine are Tranſcendently above yours, as far as Heaven is above the Earth: And ſo are <hi>My Ways</hi> above your Ways. This is true as to God's <hi>Thoughts</hi> and Purpoſes of Grace in Pardoning Sinners; and as to the Effects of thoſe kind Purpoſes in his <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Works.</hi> And the Higheſt Aſſurance of the Truth of all this is added from a Divine Teſtimony annex'd, <hi>Thus
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106979:6"/>ſaith the Lord.</hi> He who beſt knows his own Gracious Deſigns, hath told us this; and by our believing it, we ſet to our Seals that God is true. Several things might be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, as proper to be Diſcours'd of, from theſe Words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That if ever Sinners find Mercy with God, they muſt forſake their former Evil Ways and Courſe of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That 'tis not enough for ſuch to to reform their outward Practice, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Evil Ways, but they muſt be chang'd and ſanctify'd in Heart, their <hi>Evil Thoughts</hi> muſt be forſaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That 'tis not ſufficient to turn from Sin and Wickedneſs in Heart and Life, without returning unto God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the worſt of Sinners, be they wicked, as to Sins againſt God, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, as to Iniquity againſt Men; yet if they turn from their Evil Wayes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Lord, they ſhall find Mercy. Tho' you have ſinned (as you think) ſo as never any did before, and condemn your ſelves as the chiefeſt of Sinners; and have refus'd the pardoning Mercy of God former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this may be forgiven. And it is implied, that it ſhall be, upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry New Invitation and Call to Repentance, that <hi>Where Sin hath abounded, Grave ſhall much more abound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He will have Mercy, and will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106979:7"/>pardon; let him conſider the <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of this, and thereupon <hi>Return.</hi> We may here Obſerve, That the great Motive and Encouragement which puts Sinners on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their Evil Wayes, and turning to God, is a ſenſible Apprehenſion, that there is Mercy and Forgiveneſs to be had. There could be no Repentance without it, nor would it be required of us as a Duty, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and return, if there were no Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Beſides the General Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of finding Mercy with God, here is the ſpecial kind of Mercy, which the Sinner needs, and that is <hi>Pardon.</hi> I may here Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That pardoning Mercy to returning Sinners, is <hi>Mercy indeed;</hi> of all others, the moſt ſuitable, and moſt welcome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> That God will not only ſhow Mercy to Returning Sinners, but he will abundantly pardon 'em, he will multiply Pardons.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That if ever Sinners find Mercy with God, they muſt forſake their Evil Ways. The ordinary Courſe of any Man's Life is very fitly called <hi>his Way,</hi> that which is his ordinary Practice, his daily Walk. Accordingly we read of the Way of a Sinner, and the Path of the Wicked, and the Way of Evil Men: This is often call'd <hi>our own Way,</hi> in Oppoſition to the Way of Truth and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is called the <hi>Way of the Lord,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:106979:7"/>or God's Way: Becauſe he directs and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it, and enables us to walk in it, and rewards us for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>And this is the great difference between the Righteous and the Wicked: Their Courſe and Way is different. A good Man may make a falſe Step, he may ſtumble or ſtep out of the way, in a particular Inſtance, but he doth not work Iniquity, doth not walk in the way of the Ungodly, his Courſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, for the main of it, is otherwiſe. And 'tis not for one or two particular Actions, good or bad, that a Man's to be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a good or wicked Man; but from his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe of Life: If that be wicked, he muſt forſake it, or never find Mercy with God. And this muſt be done heartily and unfeignedly, ſpeedily and without delay, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially and univerſally, with full purpoſe of Heart to perſevere, and never again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Folly. Without this, there can be no Converſe with God, nor Communion with him: <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the Evil of your Doings, then come and let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Iſa. I. 16, 17. 'Till this be reſolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and begun, you are Impenitent, and ſo abominable in the ſight of God: For certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God wil lnto diſhonour his Perfections, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his Word, and proſtitute his Grace, to juſtifie the Ungodly, while they continue <hi>ſuch,</hi> without deſiring, reſolving and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to forſake their Evil Ways. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106979:8"/>Chriſt is a Saviour, to give Remiſſion of Sin, he does alſo give them Repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> V. 31.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That 'tis not enough for one, who expects to find Mercy with God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Practices, and forſake his Evil Wayes, but he muſt be inwardly ſanctify'd, his Heat renewed, his very Thoughts chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Man his thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>His Thoughts,</hi> eſpecially his Falſe, Unjuſt, Unrighteous Thoughts of God, whereof Sinners have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many: Here the Change muſt be, becauſe the Heart is the principal Seat of Sin or Grace, of Sincerity or Hypocriſie. It is in the inward Thoughts and Affections of the Heart, that Sanctification or Carnality doth principally diſcover it ſelf: 'Till the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be cleanſed, the Streams will be pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The unſanctify'd Heart is the Source of Evil Thoughts, Words and Actions: <hi>Waſh thy Heart, O Jeruſalem! how long ſhall vain Thoughts lodge in thee? As a man thinketh in his heart, ſo is he,</hi> Prov. XXIII. 7. <hi>The Thoughts of the wicked,</hi> or wicked Thoughts, <hi>they are Abomination in the ſight of God,</hi> Prov. XV. 26. And 'tis the Deſign of the Goſpel, and the Glory of it, beyond all the Philoſophy in the World, to bring our Thoughts into Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt. While any Wickedneſs is indulged, and allowed in the Heart and Thoughts, no outward Reformation, as to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106979:8"/>our Behaviour before the World, no Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from groſs Pollutions and Diſorders in the Life, will denominate us truly Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or give us Hopes of finding Mercy with God. While we regard Iniquity in our Hearts, while the Heart goes after Covetouſneſs, Filthineſs, or any allowed Luſt. Uunleſs the Thoughts be chang'd, as well as the outward Courſe; unleſs the Heart be ſanctify'd, as well as the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reform'd; there is no Forgiveneſs. You know the Woe which our Saviour denounc'd againſt the <hi>Phariſes</hi> on this Account, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXIII. 25. whom he characteriz'd as Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, becauſe they made clean the outſide of the Cup and Platter, but within were full of Extortion and Exceſs; that like whited Sepulchers, they appear'd Beautiful outward, but were within full of dead Mens Bones, and all Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">III. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Obſerve further, That 'tis not enough to turn from Sin and Wickedneſs in Heart and Life, but if you would find Mercy with God, you muſt return unto the Lord. To clear this, Conſider, That we are departed and gone off from God by Sin, both as he is our Chief Good and Sovereign Lord: We have abandon'd and forſaken him as our Portion and Felicity, and as he is our Lord and Ruler. 'Tis neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we return to him, ſo as to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue his Favour as our very Life, place all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106979:9"/>our Happineſs in his Love and Likeneſs; obſerve his Orders, and endeavour to pleaſe him; that we deſign his Honour, and make it our Buſineſs to glorifie him; and be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to him as our Ultimate End. Without reſolving on this, there's no ground to expect Mercy in the Pardon of the leaſt Sin; and upon this we may hope for For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of the greateſt.</p>
            <p>Men may break off a Courſe of Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Open Wickedneſs, upon various and different Motives, and then take up with a Negative Religion, without returning to God. They may ſatisfie themſelves, that now they don't commit the like Crimes as formerly; they may think it enough, that they are not as bad as others are, or as once they were themſelves: But this is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, if they are deſtitute of Love to God, if they are not careful to pleaſe him, if his Glory be not their End, if they do not eye his Authority, if they are not chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'd to be accepted with him, if they do not chooſe him as the Portion of their Soul, and by an entire Reſignation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, make him Lord of all; to govern their Actions by the Counſels of his Word, and to diſpoſe and order their Conditions, by his moſt Wiſe and Holy Providence. Such a turning to the Lord muſt be joyn'd with forſaking of Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">IV. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let the Wicked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106979:9"/>forſake the Evil of his Heart and Wayes, and turn to the Lord, and he ſhall find Mercy. I Obſerve, That the Vileſt and moſt Hainous Tranſgreſſors, (let their Sins be what they will,) if they penitently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, they may be aſſur'd of Pardon. Whatever Wickedneſs againſt God, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs againſt Men, whatever Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Sin, in Heart or Life, Open or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, they are charged with, yet is there Mercy with God upon true Repentance. The Holy Scriptures are full of this Doctrine. How large and general are the Invitations and Calls of God to all ſorts of Sinners? How Expreſs and Poſitive are the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Word? that even Scarlet and Crimſon Sins ſhall be as Snow and Wool; that All Sin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven, except that againſt the Holy Ghoſt, which is joyn'd with Obſtinate Impenitence, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt came to ſave the chiefeſt of Sinners, and that his Blood cleanſeth from all Sin. What a large and black Catalogue is there, of ſuch as ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of God, Fornicators, Adulterers, Idolaters, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites, Drunkards, Revilers and Extortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? and yet 'tis added, <hi>Such were ſome of you, but ye are waſhed,</hi> 1 Cor. VI. 9, 10, 11. <hi>He is a God pardoning Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin,</hi> Mic. VII. 18. How affectionately doth God expoſtulate with Sinners? even the Vileſt of them, and urge them to caſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106979:10"/>away their Tranſgreſſions, and aſſure them that he hath no pleaſure in their Ruine? How earneſtly doth he beſeech them to be reconcil'd, and hearken to the Voice of his Mercy? With what Variety of Arguments doth he plead with them? from the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Mercy offer'd, from the Freeneſs and Riches of his Grace, from the Abſolute Neceſſity of it, and from the Hazard they run of being undone for ever, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it? What Inſtances are there of the blackeſt Crimes forgiven? and the moſt Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Offenders received to Favour? with an Aſſurance, that Others may be ſo too, if they will return? <hi>Ceaſe to do Evil, Learn to do Well: Come now and let us reaſon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Iſa. I. 16. that is, there is nothing paſt ſhall be a Bar to your Reconciliation, if you will <hi>Now</hi> return; no Sin that you have ever committed ſhall be your undoing, if you will <hi>Now</hi> accept of Mercy. I may ſafely ſay this to every Man and Woman in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: And ſhould there be any that think, that they have ſinned with ſuch peculiar Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, as never any did who were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, (which I believe is not true): Yet ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it true, the Free-grace and Mercy of God hath never yet been try'd to the utmoſt: It can out-do all it hath ever done. The Aggravations of thy Guilt, can never be ſuch as to condemn thee, but the Vertue of the Blood of Chriſt is greater to pardon thee,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106979:10"/>if thou return to God by Jeſus Chriſt. As far as Heaven is above Earth, God's Thoughts are above ours in this Matter.</p>
            <p>There is an Inſtance of this in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Bible, how <hi>different</hi> God's Thoughts are from ours, and how much above them: <hi>I will not Curſe the ground any more for Man's ſake, ſaith God,</hi> Gen. VIII. <hi>becauſe the imagination of the Heart of Man is only evil, and continually evil.</hi> One would rather think, that God for that reaſon ſhould do nothing but Curſe it; but it ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, as if the kind Thoughts of God were to this purpoſe; <q>If I ſhould never leave Curſing, 'till Man leaves Sinning, I ſhould do nothing but Curſe; but I will not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I cann't hope to find Mercy, my Sin is ſo great, ſaith a Convinced Sinner; not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that 'tis the Glory of God to forgive a multitude of Sins; and that where Sin hath abounded, there is an Opportunity for Grace much more to abound. The Pſalmiſt uſeth it as an Argument in Prayer, <hi>Lord, forgive mine Iniquity, for it is great,</hi> Pſal. XXV. 11. An Argument fit to be us'd no where elſe. The greatneſs of his Sin made him fly to God for Pardon, but did not keep him from Returning. This is the Scope and Tenour of the whole Goſpel: To this do all the Prophets and Apoſtles witneſs, <hi>That through the Name of Chriſt whoever believes on him,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:106979:11"/>(without diſtinction) <hi>ſhall receive the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sin.</hi> If you are weary and heavy laden, ſenſible of Sin, and deſirous to forſake it; if you ſee your need of Chriſt, and flee to the Refuge of Hope ſet before you, you may, you ought to believe, that you ſhall find Mercy, Reſt and Forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>And for the Encouragement of the worſt of Sinners to Repent, it is Obſerved in all Ages, that many wicked People, who find Mercy with God, and are forgiven, have been much more Vile, than ſeveral of thoſe that are left to periſh in their Sins, and ſhall never be forgiven. How many that have been kept from groſs Polutions, and made a longer and fairer Profeſſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than others; who have abounded in outward Duties, who have been of more uſeful Parts, Endowments and Qualifications, more conſiderable for their Wit, Learning, and other Accompliſhments, (more capable one would think, of doing Service in the World, and the Church, and for the Glory of God, if Converted) how many ſuch are yet left to periſh in their Impenitence and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief? while Others have been call'd, and turn'd, juſtify'd, ſanctify'd and ſav'd; who have labour'd under many contrary Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and Diſadvantages, as to all theſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially by the Hainouſneſs of their former Guilt and Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Therfore conſider it ſeriouſly, if thou haſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106979:11"/>been a great Sinner, God is a gracious God, and Chriſt is a mighty Saviour, able to ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come to God by him. He can as eaſily forgive five Hundred Talents as fifty Pence, though the Debtors are very different in the Parable; <hi>Luke</hi> VII. 41. <hi>He frankly forgave them both.</hi> Not only ſuch who have ſinned in ſome leſſer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, may hope to find Mercy; but they who have run out into the groſſeſt Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, Impiety, Unrighteouſneſs and Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not only ſuch who have neglected one, or two, or ten Calls to Repentance by the Goſpel, but if they have done ſo, for many Years to this Hour, they may yet find Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <hi>Now,</hi> if forſaking their Evil Ways, they return to God by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Let your Sins paſt be what they will, ſay as bad as you will or can of your ſelves, and of the dreadful Aggravations of your Guilt, Cloath it with all the Horrour and Darkneſs poſſible; Yet, <hi>As high as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are above the Earth,</hi> ſo is the Mercy of God, and the Merit and Vertue of the Blood of Chriſt above your Guilt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 
               <q>But I have ſtood out ſo long, will ſome ſay, perſiſted in my Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo many years, ſtifled the Motions of God's Spirit ſo often, and been deaf to the Voice of God's Word, and my own Conſcience, that I fear he will never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of <hi>me,</hi> nor ever ſhew Mercy to <hi>me,</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:106979:12"/>for he call'd and I would not come, he knock'd, and I would not open, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I call, I may expect to find the Door ſhut.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in Anſwer to this, Conſider, That as long as His Word abides faithful, and the Covenant of Grace is everlaſting and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd, and the Offers of God's Grace are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; as long as there's a New Proclamation of Mercy made in the Name of Chriſt, tho' all the former have been deſpiſed, you may <hi>Now</hi> come in, and find Mercy, and be accepted <hi>Now.</hi> For every New Offer of God's Grace, doth carry in it the Offer, and Promiſe of the Pardon of all your former Refuſals, if you will <hi>Now</hi> conſent. The Promiſe is as free, and the peformance of it as ſure, now as ever. You may come in <hi>Now,</hi> and be pardon'd and ſav'd, upon as free and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Terms as ſeveral years agoe. 'Tis ſtill without Money and without Price. Your Unbelief and Obſtinacy ſo long, does not raiſe the Price, nor alter the Terms. Therefore plead the Riches of his Free-grace, and do it the more thankfully and humbly, the Viler you have been; ſaying, <q>Lord, thy Mercy will be the more honour'd, thy Free-grace will be the more magnify'd, and exalted in the Converſion and Forgiveneſs of ſuch a Wretch, in the purging ſuch a defiled Soul, in the healing ſuch a Leper, in the pardoning ſo many and great Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106979:12"/>
            <p> And 'tis often Obſerv'd, that ſuch Sinners when they return to God, have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of others upon ſeveral Accounts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is more glorify'd by them: As that uſually they admire the Grace of God more than others, love God and Chriſt more, walk more humbly with God, are more Charitable, Tender and Compaſſionate to other Chriſtians, and are uſually more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and circumſpect for the Time to come, and more afraid of falling: And commonly they are more abundant in Service, for the Honour of God; more entirely devoted to him, more zealous for his Glory, more of a Publick Spirit, more ready to do and to ſuffer any thing for his ſake. As this tends to the Honour of God, ſo it may be pleaded in Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But before I cloſe this, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate or anſwer an Objection or two more: I may ſuppoſe ſome will ſay, <q>That after all, there's no finding Mercy and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God, without <hi>Faith in Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and I can't for my Heart believe in Chriſt, that he will receive me; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade my ſelf, that ſuch a one as I ſhould be accepted: What, ſhall the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Purchaſe of the Death of Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to me? be beſtowed on me? if you'd give me all the World, I can't believe that ſuch a Wretch as I have been ſhall find Mercy: You don't know, how I have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106979:13"/>affronted, diſhonour'd, deſpis'd and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd him. I have abus'd his Grace at that dreadful Rate, that you cann't imagine the Aggravtion of my Sins, or the Sadneſs of my Caſe. I can't believe that he will ever forgive me, receive me, juſtifie me, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me: I can't believe it, and if I can't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, I can't be ſaved by him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, Don't miſtake the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſaving Faith. You ſay, you can't believe, and you have no Faith. Whereas at the bottom, you mean no more than this, that as yet, you are not certain of Salvation, you have no Aſſurance. But are you willing to receive Chriſt Jeſus, as offer'd in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel? Hath the Spirit of God ſo far convinc'd you of your ſinful, miſerable ſtate, that you heartily conſent to be ſaved by Chriſt, in his own Way, and upon his own Terms? Are you willing to take him as your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Saviour and Lord? Are you brought to depend, and truſt entirely upon the Mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt, as the only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and Man? To relye upon his Sacrifice, and meritorious Righteouſneſs, as your only Refuge and Hope? Deſiring to be found in him alone, to be accepted of God only in the Beloved? and are truly willing, and as far as you know your own Hearts, are reſolv'd to follow him as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of your Salvation, where ever he ſhall lead you; in hope of his purchaſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106979:13"/>Grace and Glory? This is Faith, and dare you ſay, that there's nothing of this that appears in the Temper of your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If you can't with any Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſay this, yet the Caſe is hopeful, if you are in the number of convinced, awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſenſible Sinners. Are you ſenſible of your Ignorance, Poverty, Guilt, Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Bondage, Unrighteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that you need Chriſt as a compleat Saviour, to be made of God unto us, Wiſdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption? to expiate Sin by his Blood, and to ſubdue it by his Spirit, to reconcile us to God, and begin that bleſſed Union and Communion here, which ſhall be compleat in Heaven? And this comprehends our whole Salvation. Chriſt is the Saviour of Sinners, and of ſuch who are loſt, who apprehend themſelves to be ſo without his help, that feel their Sins and their Wants; he came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance. And is a Phyſitian, not to the Whole, but to the Sick: He calls and cures, not the Proud, but the Humble; not the Full, but the Hungry; not the Rich, but the Poor; not the Free, but the Captive; who are ſenſible of their Bonds; not the Righteous, but Sinners. And he makes you, by his Spirit, thus humble, empty, hungry, and ſenſible of Sin; that you may look to him as the great Reconciler, ſenſible
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106979:14"/>of the need of Pardon. If it be thus, you may then look for Redemption through the Blood of Jeſus, even the Forgiveneſs of Sins: Feeling your need of Sanctification, you may look to be waſh'd and cleans'd, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by his Spirit; feeling your want of Strength to do and ſuffer the Will of God, you may look to Chriſt, to enable you to do all things. Now one that is not fully ſatisfy'd and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd; that Chriſt will ſave him, may yet be brought to this frame. How is it with you as to this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Let me ask you further, under the Senſe of being Vile and Hainous Sinners, are you brought earneſtly to deſire the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in Chriſt, and diligently to ſeek after him? Tho' you ſometimes fear he will not accept you, yet do you not neglect to pray to him? What would you not give, that you might be intereſted in God's pardoning Mercy, and accepted in Chriſt? Are not your greateſt Fears, and Concern with reſpect to this, leſt he ſhould reject you? Are not the ſtrongeſt Deſires of your Souls after this, that he would receive you? And is it thus, not only at a Pinch; in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and Trouble as to Outward Affairs, or on a ſick Bed, but in Health and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity? Is this the Language of your Souls? <q>I have Health, and Friends, and Money, and Credit, and many Outward Bleſſings
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106979:14"/>beyond others; I want nothing for my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or for my Comfortable Paſſage through this World: But I am yet a miſerable Creature, if I am under the Guilt of Sin; if God be not reconcil'd to me. O that I were clear as to this! what would I give to be at peace with God, and to have an Encouraging Senſe of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Are you ſenſible of your paſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs to this Merciful God, and Gracious Saviour, ſo as to bewail it? Is it now the ground of your Fear and Trouble? not only that you have ſinn'd againſt the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (tho' it may be, you were firſt awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd by the ſenſe of ſome ſuch Tranſgreſſion) but now you are troubl'd for the Contempt of the Goſpel, for your Neglect of Chriſt, the Saviour of Sinners, for refuſing him, when he hath call'd and invited you? And are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay within your ſelves, <q>O with what Earneſtneſs did he call me to accept his Mercy! How freely did he offer to forgive me! He would have been my Saviour, but I would not receive him; with what Folly and Obſtinacy did I harden my Heart, and ſtop my Ears, and turn my Back upon him? and reſiſted him both in his Word and Spirit?</q> Doth this greive and trouble you, as well as the groſs Pollutions of the World, which Natural Light will condemn?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Your Caſe is hopeful, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of your Vileneſs and Fears
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106979:15"/>on that Account; if you yet reſolve to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on, in ſeeking Mercy and Forgiveneſs of God by Jeſus Chriſt, 'till you obtain it. Do you reſolve you will wait, and pray, and wreſtle, and perſevere therein; 'till it ſhall pleaſe God to caſt an Eye of Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on your miſerable Souls? That you will continue in the Uſe of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Means, where he communicates his Spirit, and conveys Grace, and where he is wont to vouchſafe his Preſence? That you will enquire of every Body that may aſſiſt you, how you may be one of thoſe Happy Souls, whom God will abundantly pardon? Can you ſay this, <q>That tho' I fear and doubt, yet I ſeek, and ſtrive, and will not give over: I will not deſiſt, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his Door: I am undone if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe me; and if I periſh and dye in my Sins, and be damned for them; it ſhall be in ſeeking Mercy, and begging Mercy for Chriſt's ſake.</q> And if you can ſay this tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you may be aſſur'd you ſhall not periſh, but find Mercy. Can you ſay, and is it the real Language of your Heart? Nothing in all the Word ſhall content and ſatisfie you, or is ever like to do ſo, 'till you have ſome good hope through Grace, of finding Mercy with God. You ſearch the Scriptures, and ſearch your Hearts, and go to Miniſters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Friends, and attend Ordinances, with this Deſire and Deſign; and you pray before you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106979:15"/>come to hear, that ſome ſeaſonable, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word may drop, and reach your Caſe. <q>Alas, I uſe to hear formerly after another manner, and with other Thoughts; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſter, paſſing Sentence on the Sermon, or conſidering only, how it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd others of my Acquaintance: But now I apply all to my ſelf, now I look for my own Portion, and watch for that which principally concerns me. And by the Grace of God I will thus attend and wait, and watch at the Poſts of Wiſdoms Door, that I may find Life, <hi>Prov.</hi> VIII. 34. Though I I have but a very little Hope, and a great many Fears, conſidering what a Vile Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have been, yet I do not utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: I am told, I muſt not deſpair, and that Deſpair is a Sin, and Hope, a Duty. And therfore I will yet hold on, and wait upon the Lord, and ſeek his Mercy: Tho' I can't pray with Confidence, I will yet look up: tho' I can't ſay I believe, yet I'le not utterly deſpair: tho' I have ſinned againſt the Grace of the Goſpel, and the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, yet I hope, not above and beyond the Help and Benefit of his Grace, and Goſpel, and Blood, and Spirit. I'le therfore hold on, and wait in Hope, in the diligent uſe of all the Means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</q>

            <p n="5">V. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> I proceed to another thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable from theſe Words; <hi>Let him return,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106979:16"/>and he will have Mercy; and abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi> Let him think of that, and return, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that, be encouraged to return. I Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, <hi>That the great Motive and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put a Sinner on forſaking his Evil Ways, and returning to God, is the ſenſible Apprehenſion, that there's Mercy to be had; viz.</hi> that God will forgive, and abundantly pardon the Penitent, Returning Sinner. I confeſs, 'tis not an eaſie matter, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Doctrine, of the Forgiveneſs of Sin: Whatever Gueſs and Conjecture Men may have about it, from the Divine Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Forbearance to a ſinful World, in the Continuance of his Forfeited Mercy: Yet
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Nathanael Taylor</hi>'s Preſervative againſt <hi>Deiſm.</hi> Octavo. Lately printed.</note> without the Goſpel Revelation, we are at no Certainty about this. The <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> had ſome Imaginations and Hopes, that their Gods were placable, and inclin'd to pardon, and that was the Riſe of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piations and Sacrifices; but they had no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Promiſe or Covenant to build upon. They knew not the Mediator between God and Man, by his own Sacrifice of himſelf to make Attonement. 'Tis the Language of the Law written on our Hearts, that <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall dye:</hi> 'Tis the Voice of Natural Conſcience, that Guilt and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are inſeperable. And were there not ſomewhat known of the Doctrine of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106979:16"/>by the Revelation of it which God hath made, this would be the common Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of Mankind. I need not conſider, what particular Ways and Methods God may have, to reveal this Pardoning Mercy unto any, who are Strangers to the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word; or whether he hath done ſo: It belongs not to us to be Curious in enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about other Men, who ſhall be judged by a Righteous God, according to the Law they were under, and the Light they had. 'Tis certain, that even among thoſe to whom the Goſpel is preached, whoever they are, that are deeply convinc'd of Sin, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience awakened to apprehend the Holineſs and Juſtice of God, 'tis one of the moſt difficult things in the World, to perſwade them, that God will have Mercy, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon. It is one great Work of the Holy Spirit, to ſatisfie the Soul of this. There's no ſerious Miniſter of Chriſt, but hath abundant Experience of this, in thoſe that are awakened to any Concern for their Souls Salvation. There's Evidence ſufficient of this in <hi>David</hi>'s Frame, <hi>Pſal.</hi> CXXX. 3, 4. <hi>If thou, Lord, ſhould'ſt mark Iniquities, O Lord, who ſhould ſtand? but there is forgiveneſs with thee,</hi> &amp;c. If God ſhould mark Sin, ſo as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to puniſh it according to his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law, who could ſtand? who would eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape Condemnation? or when accuſed, ſtand in the Judgment, ſo as to be acquitted? <hi>i.e.</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106979:17"/>
               <q>'Tis not my own Caſe alone, that if God ſhould be ſtrict and ſevere with me, I am an undone and loſt Creature: But 'tis true of all the World. The Holieſt Saint on Earth can't be juſtify'd in his Sight, and what then would become of me, who have ſuch a Load of Guilt, and ſo many hainous Crimes to acknowledge?</q> In this ſenſe we find the Expreſſion of <hi>ſtanding</hi> us'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> XIV. 4. <hi>To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;</hi> that is, ſhall either be acquitted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of God. 'Tis of the ſame Import with <hi>Pſal.</hi> CXLIII. 2. <hi>Enter not into Judgment with thy Servant, O Lord, for in thy ſight no fleſh living ſhall be juſtified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider a little, with what a Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, doth <hi>David</hi> uſe ſuch Language; he ſeems to cry out in the View of his Hainous Sins, as ready to Deſpair, if not reliev'd by the Hope, that there is Forgiveneſs with God. <hi>Lord, who can ſtand?</hi> that is, how juſtly may I be Condemn'd, if I am try'd at thy Bar? According to ſtrict Juſtice, I muſt be caſt; I cannot anſwer thee for <hi>one,</hi> much leſs for <hi>all</hi> my Abominations: <hi>I cannot ſtand in the Judgment.</hi> This will be, and is, the Caſe of all Convinced Sinners; of every one of us, when we View our Sins; and the Majeſty of Heaven, whom we have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: When we conſider, how we have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted God, and deſpiſed him, and how eaſily he can cruſh us into Hell; and how
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106979:17"/>juſtly he might. When we think, how we have preferr'd a Luſt, a Trifle, a Paſſion, an Humour, before him: How we have ſlighted his Authority, abus'd his Goodneſs, defi'd his Power, weari'd his Patience, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his Grace; and by numberleſs, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Tranſgreſſions, incurr'd the Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he hath threaten'd, and made our ſelves lyable to his intolerable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Wrath. Under ſuch a Sight and Senſe of Sin, what can relieve? but the Conſideration, that there's Mercy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with God, and that He'll abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Pardon returning Sinners.</p>
            <p>This, I ſay, we are backward to believe. There's ſo much Ignorance and Blindneſs in the Minds of Sinners; there's ſuch a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Men to Judge of God by themſelves; and of his Thoughts and Ways by their own; that becauſe <hi>they</hi> could not Pardon ſuch and ſuch hainous Provocations, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated; they imagine that God will not. And there are ſo many Fears and Jealouſies in our guilty Souls, concerning God; that without the Encouragement of ſuch a Declaration of Grace, as in this Text, there could be <hi>no Repentance;</hi> there would be no Returning to God. You know what <hi>Benhadad</hi>'s Servants told him, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> XX. 31. <hi>We have heard, that the Kings of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael are Merciful Kings, let us put Sack-cloath
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106979:18"/>on our Loyns, and Ropes about our Necks, and go to the King of Iſrael, peradventure he will ſave thy Life:</hi> This gracious Method God us'd toward <hi>Iſrael, Jer.</hi> III. 12. <hi>Go, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim theſe words toward the North, ſaying, Return, O back-ſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe my anger to fall upon you; for I am Merciful, ſaith the Lord, and will not keep anger for ever. Only acknowledge thine Iniquity, that thou haſt Tranſgreſſed againſt the Lord thy God:</hi> that is, <q>Let them not cheriſh any ſuch hard Thoughts of me, as if there were no Forgiveneſs; let them not deſpair of my Mercy, as if I would not receive them, when they return.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This gives the greateſt Encouragement to Convinced Sinners, that here is a Plank to ſave them from Shipwrack, a Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Deſpair: Here's a ground for 'em to return to God with Hopes: Here's a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ſeek Mercy, that God hath proclaim'd his Readineſs to forgive, and abundantly to pardon. And methinks 'tis very plain, that the Doctrine of <hi>Repentance</hi> would never have been preached, if there were no Hope of <hi>Forgiveneſs:</hi> The fallen Angels having no Mercy offer'd, were never call'd to repent; for let there be never ſo deep Conviction of Sin, and Sorrow for it, there could be no Repenting and Returning to God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out believing that Mercy might be had: All
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106979:18"/>would end in Death and Deſparation. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> would never be commanded as a <hi>Duty,</hi> nor urg'd upon Sinners as a Duty; (it could not, if we believe the Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs of God) were it not for this Truth, that <hi>If the wicked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his way,</hi> &amp;c. But upon the Conſideration of this, Sinners begin to have good Thoughts of God, many of their Scruples are remov'd, many of their Objections anſwer'd, and they are now encourag'd to ſeek the Mercy of God, and prepare to receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</hi> To Conclude therefore, Let the vileſt and worſt of Sinners receive theſe glad Tydings of God's Grace, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe them. Don't deſpiſe this Meſſage, don't neglect it; but conſider how much you need this Mercy; and go home, and earneſtly beg it. Endeavour to welcome it, as it is offer'd in the Goſpel; and then plead it, and urge it for Chriſt's ſake, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, as it is <hi>Free-Mercy:</hi> And ſtir up your Souls to hope in it; as knowing that <hi>God takes pleaſure in them that hope in his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May I not therfore ſay, that 'tis from the <hi>Devil,</hi> (for whom there is no Mercy) if there be any of you, to whom this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is preached, who will yet Conclude, <hi>There's no Mercy for you?</hi> Since God hath told

            <p>'TIS of the <hi>Sixth Obſervation</hi> from theſe Words that I would now ſpeak, (without ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the other five,) <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy to Penitent Sinners, is Mercy indeed;</hi> the moſt valuable and ſeaſonable Mercy. This I ſhall endeavour to manifeſt by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conſiderations, and then Apply it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There's nothing more ſuitable to the Caſe of a Guilty Sinner, who hath any Thoughts of returning to God. Conſider
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106979:20"/>the Perplexities of one that is awakened to a Senſe of Sin, and is under a Spirit of Conviction: His bitter Complaints, and loud Cryes tell us, that he knows not what to do, nor how to be rid of his Burden: He apprehends his Danger from unpardoned Sin, and feels the want of this Forgiveneſs: He is wounded, and nothing but the Voice of Pardoning Mercy can heal him. <hi>I have greatly ſinn'd,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> and his Heart ſmote him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> XXIV. 10. <hi>And now, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, O Lord, take away the Iniquity of thy Servant:</hi> Nothing elſe could give him Eaſe and Quiet from an Accuſing troubled Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>The Inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick, the People that dwell therein ſhall be forgiven their Iniquity,</hi> Iſa. XXXIII. 24. The meer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Forbearance of God, without Forgiveneſs, will not anſwer the Exigence of his Caſe. Tho' he be yet out of Hell, he knows not how long it ſhall be ſo; or how ſoon he may there have a Miſerable Portion. 'Tis the Senſe of Unpardon'd Sin that breaks his Bones, and dryeth up his Marrow; and ſticks like an Arrow in his fleſh. Whereas Pardoning Mercy is as Health to the Navel, and Marrow to the Bones, and a Cordial to his Heart; yea, even as <hi>Life from the Dead.</hi> And dead he is in Law, as under a Sentence of Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'till he be intereſted in Forgiveneſs, by Faith in the Blood of Jeſus. Then may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106979:20"/>he lift up his Head, as one Alive from the Dead; and admit Conſolation; when he can hope his Sins are forgiven; and that God is reconciled. <hi>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſay unto Jeruſalem, her Warfare is Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, her Iniquity is forgiven,</hi> Iſa. XL. 1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man whoſe Iniquity is forgiven, and Sin covered,</hi> Pſal. XXXII. 1. 'Till then, they are under the Curſe of God on Record: A Curſe, that cuts off from God, and all gracious Communications from him; a Curſe which pierceth deep, and ſpreadeth far, and makes the whole Creation at Enmity with us: And this Curſe is intolerable in the Effects of it, and unavoidable too. There is no Relief or Remedy againſt it, but by the New Covenant, and Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. 'Tis only by the Redemption we have in Jeſus Chriſt, through his Blood, even the Forgiveneſs of Sins: In which Forgiveneſs we can never be intereſted, without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>There is no Reſt in my Bones, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my Sin,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; <hi>Pſal.</hi> XXXVIII. 3. <hi>My Sins are an heavy Burden, they are too heavy for me,</hi> v. 4. 'Till this Burden be removed by Forgiveneſs, what Eaſe or Reſt can a Sinner enjoy?</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Deceit of ſenſual Pleaſures, or the Hurry and Clatter of Worldly Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, may hinder the Senſe of this for a while; and keep all quiet: Yet ſooner or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106979:21"/>later, the ſinful Soul will have Torment: Conſcience will awake. Men may laugh and be merry for a Time, make a ſhift to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident and ſecure, under the Wrath and Curſe of God; they may take their Poyſon for their Antidote, their Wound for their Plaiſter, their Plague for their Cure, their Diſeaſe for their Remedy; and ſo make a hard ſhift to preſerve a little falſe Peace: But the End will be the moſt horrid Deſpair. And the more Jovial and Airy, Careleſs and Preſumptuous, they have been in Health and Proſperity, under the Guilt of great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; the more diſconſolate will ſuch be, when Conſcience awakes, to ſet their Sins in order before them. Is there then any Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage like that of Forgiveneſs, that will ſuit the Caſe of ſuch? They can reliſh nothing elſe, think of nothing elſe, this is what they aim at. This is the Subject of their great Enquiry, <hi>How they may be forgiven.</hi> They may try in vain, what Company, Mirth, Sports, Buſineſs, or Superſtition will do: They muſt come to God for Pardon, or they cannot find Reſt. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> V. 13. <hi>When Ephrahim ſaw his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Judah ſaw his wound; then went Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im to the Aſſvrian, and ſent to King Jareb; yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did you know the Miſery and Danger of a ſinful Soul, unreconciled to God, bound over to his Eternal Wrath, every Moment
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106979:21"/>expos'd as a Guilty Wretch, to his fiery Vengeance? Did you conſider the Caſe of ſuch a One? who hath all the Plagues and Curſes in the Book of God, in force againſt him; and nothing but a little Breath between him and Endleſs Ruine; that can't tell but the next Day or Minute, Death may open the Door, and let him fall into Damnation? Did any one rightly underſtand this, believe it, conſider it, and apply it as his own Caſe? what Mercy will ſuit ſuch a One, but <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy?</hi> What is all the Pomp and Glory of this World to ſuch a Man, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Forgiveneſs of Sin? How can he eat, drink or ſleep, or trade, or do any thing, without ſome Hope of Pardon? without ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it? without endeavouring it? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing means in Order to it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Pardoning Mercy is Mercy <hi>indeed,</hi> as 'tis the Fruit of Covenant Love, an Effect of the ſpecial, diſtinguiſhing Love of God: This is the great Priviledge of ſuch whoſe God is the Lord. This is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Bleſſing, that's never given in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: This is never beſtow'd, but as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, peculiar to God's People. This is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompany'd with Regeneration, and Adoption, <hi>Jer.</hi> XXXI. 33. <hi>I will be their God, and will forgive their Iniquity. Happy is the Man whoſe Iniquity is forgiven, Happy is the People whoſe God is the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Mercy is the moſt Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106979:22"/>Bleſſing, and the Foundation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Mercies. This ſecures our State, ſweetens our other Bleſſings, lays the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for Peace of Conſcience, gives Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Acceſs to the Throne of Grace, and makes way for Communion with God in all Ordinances: This clears us from the Accuſation of Satan, the Condemnation of the Law, and of our own Hearts; for who ſhall lay any thing to his Charge, whom God forgives? We can have no Right and Title to Eternal Life without this: For the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Bar muſt be removed by the Pardon of Sin, as well as the Moral Incapacity by the Sanctifying Spirit. The great Bleſſings of the Goſpel, ſuch as the Spirit of Holineſs, Communion with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Accompany this of Forgiveneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> VIII. latter End. <hi>I will be merciful to their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, and their Iniquities I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no more.</hi> By this we not only eſcape the Puniſhment due to Sin, which would render us deeply miſerable, but are reſtored to the Favour of God, and accepted in the Beloved, and have Grace to overcome the World, Fleſh, and Devil. The ſanctifying Spirit to purge us from all Filthineſs, is joyn'd with this Pardon, which delivers from the Condemning Guilt of Sin. We are tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Kingdom and Family of Chriſt, as well as deliver'd from the Kingdom of Satan, and the Power of Darkneſs. In a Word, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106979:22"/>Acceptation of our Perſons, Sanctification of our Natures, the Anſwer of our Prayers, and a Title to Heaven and Eternal Life, are connected with, and conſequent to this Forgiveneſs of Sin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> XXXII. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Zac.</hi> I. 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> LIX. 2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> CIII. 2, 3. <hi>Job</hi> VII. 21.</p>
            <p>This alſo hath reſpect to all the Comforts, and Afflictions of this preſent Life. You ought to Conſider, that if Sin be forgiven, all things ſhall work for good. <hi>Take away all Iniquity,</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>and receive us graciouſly, or do us good,</hi> Hoſ. XIV. 2. Every Providence ſhall be ſanctified, if Sin be forgiven. <hi>For peace I had great bitterneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezekiah, but in love to my Soul, thou haſt deliver'd it from the Pit of Corruption; for thou haſt caſt all my ſins behind thy Back,</hi> Iſa. XXXVIII. 17. You have a like Inſtance, <hi>Jer.</hi> XXXIII. 6, 8. But if you had all the Plenty, Peace, Health, Riches and Grandeur of this World, yet the Guilt of one Sin on the Conſclence, under the Apprehenſion of God's deſerved Wrath, will ſpoil the Reliſh of all. Where Sin is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, other Mercies will be ſweet, and the Burden of Affliction tolerable: But without this, and under the Apprehenſions of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, every Temporal Calamity is double. For this is the Wormwood and the Gall in every bitter Cup. We ſhall not under the Troubles and Diſappointments of this World, cry out we are <hi>undone,</hi> if we can think that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106979:23"/>God hath forgiven us: No more than a Man, who has juſt receiv'd his Prince's Pardon, (when he lay under a Sentence of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Death) can be thought, if he loſe his Glove or Handkerchief in the way home, that he will wring his Hands, and weep, and take on for ſuch a Loſs, when he had ſo lately his Life graciouſly given him.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Hereby is a Foundation laid for a Life of Thankful Love and Obedience to God. Conſcience being purg'd from dead Works, we ſerve the Living God without fear, in hope of his Acceptance; with the Promiſe of his hearing our Prayers, and that he will be well pleaſed with our Services, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look our Infirmities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well bear the Tryals of this Life with Patience and Reſignation; and in a dying Hour, ſhall be able to commend our Souls with Faith and Hope, into the Hands of Chriſt, who will take Care of us as his own, when we leave the World; and at laſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly acknowledge and abſolve us in the great Day. Oh how many Mercies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this one, of the Forgiveneſs of Sin!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This is Mercy <hi>indeed</hi> to a Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner; Peculiar Mercy, as it it <hi>Irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</hi> Where Sin is forgiven, and Iniquity blotted out, it ſhall be remember'd <hi>no more.</hi> You are freely juſtify'd from all things, and ſhall never come into Condemnation. <hi>This my Covenant of Peace ſhall never be removed,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106979:23"/>ſaith the Lord, who hath mercy on thee,</hi> Iſa. LIV. 10. This is not only true of the firſt Settlement of it, but is the Priviledge of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, who is under the Bond and Bleſſing of the New Covenant. <hi>Tho' I viſit his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with a Rod, and his Iniquity with Stripes, nevertheleſs my loving Kindneſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my Faithfulneſs to fail; my Covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my Lips.</hi> God may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sins of Pardoned Believers, ſo as to afflict them in this World, and exerciſe the Diſcipline of his Family: Their ſhare in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Sins, may involve them in preſent Sufferings with others: And for particular Tranſgreſſions, God may teſtifie his Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Diſpleaſure againſt good Men, by remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Afflictions; but will not reverſe their Pardon, ſo as to puniſh them Eternally. <hi>Ely, David, Jonah,</hi> and others are Inſtances. Your Peace with Heaven ſhall never be ſo broken; none of your Afflictions will prove it. The Reconciliation between God and Sinners, that is once accepted by a Real, Active, Unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Obedient Faith, is Perpetual. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, that our Iniquities ſhall be <hi>blotted out,</hi> and <hi>remember'd no more;</hi> that God will <hi>caſt 'em behind his Back; Caſt 'em into the bottom of the Sea; Scatter 'em as a thick Cloud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> XLIII. 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> LI. 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> XXXVIII. 17. <hi>Mic.</hi> VII. 19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> XLIV. 22. And yet more expreſly to aſſure us, that God will not enter
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106979:24"/>into Judgment with us, for the Sins he hath once forgiven, we read, <hi>Jer.</hi> L. 20. <hi>In that day ſhall the Iniquity of Iſrael be ſought for, and there ſhall be none; and the Sins of Judah, and they ſhall not be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where God beſtows Forgiveneſs, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates the Spirit of Grace, for the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of Sin. And tho' that Work be not perfect, it ſhall be progreſſive; and the Remainders of Corruption in the Soul, will not prove that your Sin is not forgiven. The Fleſh will war againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit will ſtrive againſt the Fleſh; but you can't conclude, that you are not forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from the Oppoſition that Sin makes againſt the Grace of God in the Soul. Would you judge of your ſelves? conſider what Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition you make againſt Sin: Would you have Relief? Apply to the Fountain open, to the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, for new Strength from Day to Day, to Crucifie the Fleſh, to Continue the Warfare, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Conflict. That Sin yet remains in the Soul, is conſiſtent with your Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to God; and your Sence of this, with his Acceptance of you. Yea, I am perſwaded, there's never ſuch a Diſcovery of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as after Forgiveneſs; when the Grace of God hath enlightned the Soul. But which part do you ſide with? Do you Condemn, Bewail, Oppoſe, Reſiſt, Strive, Watch, Pray, Fight, and Endeavour the Mortification of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106979:24"/>Corruption, that yet remains, after the Hopes of Pardon? You ſhall then by the Grace of Chriſt hold on, and be more than Conquerors: You ſhould Apply to him, and Exalt his Power, as able to deſtroy the Works of the Devil. He has promiſed, and undertaken it, that no Iniquity ſhall be charged to your Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No old Stories ſhall be repeated, no latent Diſpleaſure harboured, no former Quarrel revived. If thou return to God with all thy Heart, he will never upbraid thee with thy former Sins; tho' Men may. But if you can hope, that God forgives you, you'll eaſily bear <hi>that,</hi> and little mind it. Can you doubt of this Fulneſs of Pardon, when God hath ſaid, he will hide and blot out our Sins, ſo as <hi>When ſought for they ſhall not be found:</hi> And that he will <hi>put them as far from us, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt;</hi> that <hi>None of them ſhall be mentioned again unto us,</hi> Pſal. CIII. 10. Jer. XXXI. 34.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This Pardoning Mercy is <hi>Mercy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> to a Returning Sinner, becauſe all his <hi>unknown</hi> and <hi>forgotten Sins</hi> ſhall be pardoned, as well as thoſe he hath particularly confeſs'd, agravated, and repented of. As he that breaks the Law in one Point is guilty of all, by the wilful Contempt of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; ſo he that is abſolved in one Point, is forgiven in all. It were otherwiſe in vain to be forgiven, and abſolved as to <hi>ſome Sins,</hi> that might damn us, if there's <hi>any one</hi> left
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:106979:25"/>that would do it. He that is under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for one Sin, is liable to Eternal Death: But Divine Forgiveneſs is entire and full. There are Sins of Good Men, that ariſe from Humane Frailty, and not from any evil Purpoſe of Heart; as Sins of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> which if we had known, we would not have committed; or of <hi>ſudden Surprize,</hi> that we did not Obſerve; or fell into by the violent hurry of Temptation, before we had time to think what we were doing; of ſuch Sins we ſhall be often guilty, while we are in the World; and we are bid to ask daily Pardon for 'em; and then they ſhall not break Covenant between God and Us.</p>
            <p>But there are Many Sins that we have <hi>forgotten,</hi> for which we were never Humbled in Particular: And yet if we truly Repent of thoſe we do know, and call to mind, <hi>our forgotten Sins ſhall be forgiven.</hi> For God will Pardon us like himſelf; Forgive us like <hi>a God;</hi> not according to <hi>our Knowledge,</hi> but <hi>His own.</hi> And as He is greater than our Hearts, to know much more againſt us, than we can remember againſt our ſelves; ſo He is greater than our Hearts, to forgive even thoſe Faults which our Hearts and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do not Recollect. He knows the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of Chriſt's Blood and Merits, to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give all our Sins. And by unfeigned Faith, we are intereſted in the Virtue of it. God hath more Thoughts of Mercy in him, than
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106979:25"/>we have had of Rebellion againſt him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> XL. 5. <hi>Thy Thoughts to us-ward,</hi> (ſpeaking of his Thoughts of Mercy) <hi>are more than can be numbred.</hi> They have been from Everlaſting, and reach to Everlaſting; whereas 'tis but as of yeſterday, that the oldeſt Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to rebel againſt God. There is no Compariſon. And this leads to the <hi>Laſt Obſervation</hi> from thoſe Words, <hi>He will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt Obſ.</hi> That God will not only ſhow Mercy to Returning Sinners, ſo as to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, but <hi>He will abundantly Pardon:</hi> He will <hi>Multiply Forgiveneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that it was <hi>exceeding abundant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with Faith and Love, which is in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> 1 Tim.

I. 6, 7. and this joyn'd with <hi>tender Mercies;</hi> with <hi>Loving Kindneſs;</hi> and with <hi>Multitudes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> And here I may ſhow,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In what Reſpects, God will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Pardon Returning Sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider what Reaſon we have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106979:26"/>to believe it, and be firmly perſwaded of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What is the Abuſe of this Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I ſhall aſſiſt you to make a Right Improvement of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In what reſpects God promiſeth <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to Pardon,</hi> or to Multiply Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. And this I might ſhow as to <hi>Perſons,</hi> and as to <hi>Things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we Conſider the Extent of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs as to <hi>Sins:</hi> With Reference to Time, and Place, and Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As to <hi>Time,</hi> from the firſt Promiſe of the Seed of the Woman, made ſoon after the Fall, to the End of the World, this door of Mercy is open for Returning Sinners. As to <hi>Places,</hi> The Goſpel is appointed to be Preach'd to every Creature, in every part of the World: Neither Jew, nor Gentile, Bond, nor Free, Barbarian, or Scythian, are excepted. The Goſpel of Grace by Chriſt Jeſus is <hi>every where</hi> the Power of God, to Pardon, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unto <hi>all</hi> that believe. As to <hi>Perſons,</hi> none ſhall Periſh for want of a ſufficient Price, for their Ranſom; for want of a ſufficient Satisfaction to the Juſtice of God: But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Everlaſting Goſpel is preached, <hi>He that Believeth ſhall be ſaved. Whoever will, may come, and take of the Waters of Life freely.</hi> Whoever will Accept of the Mercy of Chriſt, upon the holy Terms of the Goſpel, ſhall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106979:26"/>receive Remiſſion of Sins, <hi>Joh.</hi> III. 10. <hi>God hath ſo Loved the</hi> loſt <hi>World, that Whoſoever Believeth on Chriſt ſhall not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. XII. 46, 47. <hi>I am come</hi> (ſaith our Lord) <hi>a Light into the World, that Whoſoever Believeth in me ſhould not abide in darkneſs. If any Man hear my Words, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, I judge him not, for I came not to Judge the World, but to ſave the World.</hi> 1 Joh. II. 2. <hi>He is a Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And when we Conſider what ſort of Perſons, (even the chiefeſt and vileſt of Sinners,) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe have been, who have been Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd and received to Mercy; We muſt needs ſay, there is no Reſpect of Perſons with God, as to this Matter. And there are a great Multitude of theſe, conſidered in themſelves. For even of Martyrs and Confeſſors, that came out of great Tribulation, and had waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb, there is a <hi>Vaſt Multitude, ſuch as none could number of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues,</hi> Rev. VII. 9, 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He doth abundantly Pardon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the <hi>Sins forgiven.</hi> He is a God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin; <hi>i.e.</hi> Sins of all ſorts. Let the Kinds, Numbers, Repetitions, Aggravations be what they will. There is a Multitude of tender Mercies to forgive, and abundant Vertue in the Blood
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106979:27"/>of Chriſt, to cleanſe from all Sin. If the multitude of Tranſgreſſions could make a Pile, as high as from Earth to Heaven, God's pardoning Mercy is above the Heavens: His Thoughts are above ours in this matter of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, as far as the Heavens are above the Earth. No Sin but <hi>final</hi> Impenitence, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and Unbelief, is ſhut out from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; for the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is attended with that, and therfore never to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>And as to Sins <hi>after Repentance</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> God hath promiſed to multiply Forgiveneſſes, to heal Backſlidings, and therfore invites Men to return, with a Promiſe of Pardon. <hi>Return ye backſliding Children, and I will heal your Backſlidings.</hi> In ſome early Days of the Chriſtian Church, the <hi>Novatian Doctrine</hi> ſpread, that denies Repentance and Pardon to Sins af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Baptiſm; upon which Account 'tis thought, many good Men delay'd their Baptiſm as long as they could, that they might not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file their Garments after they were waſhed. It ſeem'd to have taken its Riſe from the Miſunderſtanding of <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. the Beginning. But any ſuch Doctrine as would diſcourage Men's Repentance, and return to God, after they have ſinned, muſt needs be of very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence to the Souls of Men. I confeſs, it is a diſmal Symptom, to fall often into wilful Sin, to repent and then ſin again; to repent and ſin in a Circle. This rather
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106979:27"/>argues an Intention of ſinning again, than a Deſign of leaving it. But for ſuch as have return'd to God, and been forgiven, and yet by the Power of Temptation have afterwards fallen, there is great Encouragement for their Return, and Ground to hope for Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>For if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, who was a Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> If <hi>any Man</hi> ſin, 'tis not to encourage to ſin, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <hi>Deſpair</hi> after the Commiſſion of it. And ſince we are to forgive one another, as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven us, it would never have been made our Duty to forgive our Offending Brother once and again. Yea, unto <hi>ſeventy times ſeven,</hi> if there were no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with God for Returning Backſliders. You are allowed, and commanded in ſuch a Caſe, to return to God, and to ſue out your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and you ought to believe you ſhall find Welcome, and that your Backſlidings ſhall be healed.</p>
            <p>There is need of urging this, becauſe Sins after Repentance, and after Vows and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, and Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, but diſturb the Conſcience; and you can't preſently approach to God with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort? What then ſhould you do? Give up all for loſt? Run into Exceſs of Riot? and ſay, <hi>There is no Hope;</hi> therfore let us walk after the Imagination of our own Hearts? No, by no Means. But by renewed Acts
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106979:28"/>of Repentance towards God, and of Faith in the Blood of Jeſus, return to God, and ſeek Forgiveneſs. I grant in ſuch Caſes, it is hard to do this with any Encouragement and Hope: Our Hearts miſgive us, and well they may; we ſhall have a thouſand Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Fears: And it can't be otherwiſe. However, God's Thoughts are not as ours, <hi>He will abundantly pardon</hi> Returning Sinners; tho' you have abus'd his Grace, tho' you have diſhonour'd his Name, revolted after For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, ſlighted the Redeemer Chriſt, griev'd his Spirit, given Advantage to the Devil, deſerv'd to be caſt out of his ſight; tho' you have broken your ſolemn Vows, and broken your Peace thereby; yet let ſuch remember, that God will ſhow Mercy to Returning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and he will <hi>abundantly pardon</hi> 'em. He will heal their Backſlidings, and make them loath themſelves, and be confounded for all their Abominations, even <hi>After he is pacify'd towards them,</hi> Ezek. XVI. <hi>the laſt.</hi> You know the kind Language God us'd to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. XXXI. 18, 20. <hi>Surely I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf, he is my dear Son, he is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Child,</hi> (or rather, is he not ſo?) <hi>though I ſpake aginſt him, I remember him ſtill, my Bowels are moved for him, I will ſurely have mercy on him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Read with Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Mic.</hi> VII. 18, 19. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee? that pardoneth Iniquity, and paſſeth by the Tranſgreſſions of his Remnant, and retaineth not
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106979:28"/>his Anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? He will turn again, and have compaſſion on us, and will ſubdue our Iniquities, and caſt our Sins into the Depths of the Sea.</hi> And how ſweet is the Repentance of ſuch a Returning Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlider, that is kindly melted, humbled, and broken, and brought to the Foot of God, with Hope of Mercy through Chriſt? The Contrition of ſuch a Soul, is made up like that of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> of Tears and of Kiſſes, of Sorrow and of Love, of Humility and Hope, of Confuſion and Confidence, of Shame and Joy. And how will ſuch a Soul love much, to whom much is thus forgiven?</p>
            <p>In ſhort, God doth abundantly pardon, and multiply Pardons, as to the Forgiveneſs of <hi>many Sins,</hi> in that never any one Sin was forgiven to any Man, to whom this was not made good. Numberleſs Sins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given wherever <hi>one</hi> is. They are more than the Hairs of our Head, or the Sands on the Sea-ſhore. Well might the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>Have mercy on me, O Lord, according to thy loving Kindneſſes, and according to the multitude of thy tender Mercies,</hi> Pſal. LI. 1. I will <hi>abundantly</hi> pardon, (ſaith God here) and in another place, <hi>I will cleanſe them from all their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereby they have ſinn'd againſt me, whereby they have treſpaſs'd againſt me,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>Jer.</hi> XXXII. 8. Who can underſtand his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors before Converſion and ſince? by Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Commiſſion, in Thought, in Word
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106979:29"/>and Act? How long did God wait on ſome of us? What various Methods did he uſe to bring us home? How graciouſly did he receive us at firſt? and after many Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations receive us again? Surely if <hi>we</hi> find Mercy with God, any of us, he muſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon us, and multiply Forgiveneſſes. And becauſe 'tis not ſo eaſie a thing to believe this, I proceed to the Second Particular, to Conſider what Reaſon we have to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Upon <hi>what Grounds</hi> may we be firmly perſwaded of this Truth, <hi>That God will thus multiply Pardons?</hi> 'Tis certain, to an humbl'd, awaken'd, convinced, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinner, it muſt be glad Tydings of great Joy; that his Caſe will admit of Hope. That he ought not to deſpair, that there is a <hi>poſſibility</hi> he may find Mercy with God, if no more: But to have the Riches of God's Grace diſplay'd, to have a free and general Invitation made to all the Hungry and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, the Weary and Heavy laden; to have a Promiſe of Mercy and of Forgiveneſs, whatever thy Sins have been. What mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Rejoycing is this? This will anſwer a thouſand Objections, which otherwiſe you could not tell what to ſay to. This is proper to revive the moſt drooping Spirits, to make them adore God, and admire his glorious Grace: This may cauſe them to think honourably of him, ſeek ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106979:29"/>to him, and thankfully accept his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Mercy; as poor, wretched, periſhing, condemn'd, undone Creatures; toward whom the God of all Grace will magnifie his Rich and Undeſerved Mercy. Therfore, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to believe it; conſidering ſuch things as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there are large and expreſs Promiſes, and moſt aſtoniſhing Inſtances, in the Holy Scriptures, to Encourage your Faith, He that beſt underſtands his own kind Thoughts to the Children of Men, to the chiefeſt of Sinners, hath aſſured you he will not only have Mercy, but <hi>abundantly</hi> pardon; and that where Sin hath abounded, Grace ſhall much more abound toward all of them, who will accept of Mercy by Jeſus Chriſt; ſo as God may not loſe the Glory of it. You think it very hard to be perſwaded of this, but hath not God told you, that as far as the Heavens are above the Earth, ſo are his Thoughts and Ways above yours? And tho' your Sins be as Crimſon and Scarlet, that they ſhall be as Snow and Wool; and that <hi>To the Lord our God, belong Mercies and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho' we have rebell'd againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Have we not Inſtances of this, as to others? of the worſt of Men and Women, that have been waſhed and juſtify'd, through the Blood of Chriſt, and Spirit of Chriſt? of Sinks of Sin, that have been made Veſſels of Mercy? Many Examples in the Old Teſtament and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106979:30"/>in the New, of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles?</hi> What Folly, and what aggravated Sin was <hi>David</hi> guilty of, after the Knowledge of God? and what great Sins before Converſion was the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> charg'd with? You have been ſometimes told, that 'tis an Inſtance of God's Wiſdom and Kindneſs, to record the the Example of <hi>David</hi>'s Fall. Some it may be, think it were better left out, leſt it ſhould encourage Sinners, but doubtleſs many a Man would have periſhed in Deſpair, and made away himſelf, if it had not been for the Example of <hi>David's Repentance;</hi> and God's Forgiveneſs of him, after ſuch hainous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God hath declared this to be his Nature and Delight. He proclaims it as part of his Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> XXXIV. 5, 6. to be <hi>The Lord God, Gracious and Merciful, Slow to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and Abundant in Goodneſs and Truth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin.</hi> He is pleas'd in the Exerciſe of his Mercy, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to be Gracious, and takes pleaſure in them that hope in his Mercy. And therfore what pleaſeth him, and he delights to do, he will do <hi>abundantly.</hi> There is an Inexhauſted Treaſure of Grace in God, <hi>Exceeding Riches of Grace,</hi> and unſearchable Depths of Mercy and Grace. <hi>God, who is rich in mercy,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for the great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us together with Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. II. 4, 5. And
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106979:30"/>all the Saints are ſet forth, as ſtudious and thoughtful about the Glorious Dimenſions of God's Grace, as endeavouring to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Breadth, Length, Height,</hi> and <hi>Depth</hi> of this Grace, that paſſeth Knowledge, <hi>Eph.</hi> I. 8. The <hi>Breadth</hi> of his Love, in covering ſuch a multitude of Sins, and pardoning ſuch a multitude of Sinners: The <hi>Depth</hi> of it, reaching us in the Depth of our Sin and Miſery: The <hi>Length</hi> of it, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting: The <hi>Height</hi> of it, in raiſing us from a deſerved Hell, to an infinitely Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Heaven. Love, Grace and Mercy, are his Nature and Delight. 'Tis above our Thoughts, and paſt our Comprehenſion. We read, that his <hi>Judgments</hi> are <hi>unſearchable,</hi> and his Ways paſt finding out; 'tis as true of his Ways of Mercy, as of any. By that Name <hi>Judgments,</hi> ſometimes his Mercies are call'd, <hi>Pſal.</hi> XXXVI. 5, 6. <hi>Thy Judgments are a great deep;</hi> to ſhow the Meaning whereof, the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt breaks out, <hi>O Lord, how excellent is thy Loving Kindneſs to the Sons of Men, that put their truſt in thee?</hi> All the <hi>Merits of Chriſt</hi> are call'd <hi>the Mercies of God, the ſure Mercies of David.</hi> God is ſaid to be <hi>Rich</hi> in Mercy, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Attribute of God is call'd <hi>his Riches,</hi> but his Goodneſs, Grace and Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God uſeth variety of Arguments throughout the Scriptures, to perſwade us to believe this. He not only urgeth us from his own Example, and obliges us to forgive
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106979:31"/>our Treſpaſſing Brother, (if he repent) unto ſeventy times ſeven, but with the greateſt Kindneſs, he beſpeaks us to believe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, to be perſwaded of his Tenderneſs and Love. He employs a great deal of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick to that purpoſe. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and ſpeakeſt O Iſrael, my way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is paſſed over from my God; haſt thou not known, haſt thou not heard? that the everlaſting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the Earth, fainteth not, neither is weary?</hi> Iſa. XL. 7, 8. He appeals to Heaven and Earth, to the Dumb and Inſenſible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; that his Ways are equal, that ours are unequal; he offers, he invites, he calls, and expoſtulates, and complains of our Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to believe him; he pleads, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, and adds his <hi>Oath</hi> to his Word, <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, i. e.</hi> As I am a Living God, <hi>I take no pleaſure in the death of him that dyeth, but rather that he return and live, than go on and dye. Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye dye, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> He's repreſented as with Sighs and Groans, bewailing the Obſtinacy of Sinners to their own Deſtruction. <hi>O that they were wiſe, and would conſider this! O that there were ſuch a Heart in them? O that they knew the things that belong to their peace, before they are hid from their Eyes!</hi> How kind and encouraging are ſuch Paſſages?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider, this is one great End of God's Patience, and Forbearance, and of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106979:31"/>his continuing the Preaching of the Word, and the Ordinances of the Goſpel; that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might be led to Repentance, by the Hopes of Forgiveneſs. How many Years hath God waited on ſome of you? Should not the Long-ſuffering of God, that hath a Tendency to Salvation, encourage you to believe, that there is Mercy and Forgiveneſs with him? What quick Diſpatch hath he made with others, while he hath ſpared you? He hath taken ſome, in the Act of their Vile Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations; many in the very height of their Wickedneſs; and hath refus'd to give them further time and ſpace to repent: He hath call'd ſome to Judgment in their Youth, ſoon after they had broken the Fetters of their Education, caſt off the God of their Fathers, and begun to indulge themſelves in youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts: Many beſure, (not greater Sinners than you) are gone to their place, while he yet waits to be gracious to you. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers you Pardon and Life, when he might have condemn'd you to Remedileſs Wrath, and put it in Execution long ago. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to exerciſe great Patience and Power in forbearing you. Is it not with this kind Deſign, that it might lead you to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that you might turn to him, ſeek after him, and intreat his Pity before it be too late? May you not infer thus much from his Long-ſuffering? Did he bear with thee, when thy Heart was hard as a Rock? and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106979:32"/>thou would'ſt not hearken to any Treaty of Peace? and will he not accept thee <hi>now</hi> thy Heart begins to be contrite, and broken with Sence of Sin, and Sorrow for it? Did he bear with thee while Sin was thy Delight? and will he not be gracious if thou ſeek him, <hi>now</hi> Sin is become thy Burthen? Doth he continue to call thee by his Word? and Commiſſion his Miniſters to tell thee in his Name, that if thou return, he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon? Doth he order them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee for Chriſt's ſake, and in his ſtead, that thou would'ſt be reconciled to God? and can you ſuppoſe he is inexorable? If a King ſhould ſend one of his Attendants to a Condemned Priſoner, ſaying, <q>Go tell ſuch a one, let him come to me for his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and he ſhall have it; my Son hath interceeded for him, and made his Peace, tho' he hath forfeited his Life, and deſerv'd to dye, and I might put the Sentence in Execution to Morrow; yet let him come, and confeſs his Sin, and ask Forgiveneſs, and I will pardon him. Yea, tell him, I deſire, I entreat, that he would come. I beg that he would have pity on himſelf, and not refuſe me: I earneſtly pray, and beſeech him; I muſt take no Denial, he muſt come.</q> What Kindneſs and Condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention were this! You know how to apply it. 'Tis as certain unto all of you, by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, as if you were ſpoken to by Name.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:106979:32"/>
            <p> But if you reject the kind Offer of the Grace of the Goſpel, and will not return from your Evil Ways, but go on and put it to the venture; (after ſuch a Merciful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation, and that ſo often repeated) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, what a Hazard you run, and if you hold on, how dreadful your Doom will be. All the Miniſters of Chriſt, inſtead of Bleſſing you in the Name of the Lord, muſt pronounce againſt you all the Curſes of the Law, and all the additional Curſes, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt the Deſpiſers of the Goſpel. And muſt ſay unto you, <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> Curſed in this World, 'till the Coming of Chriſt; and when he comes, Accurſed from his bleſſed Preſence, into Everlaſting Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Yea, all the Angels of God, all the Churches of Chriſt, all the Saints on Earth and in Heaven, will adore Divine Juſtice, and can have no Compaſſion on you, if you go on to deſpiſe the Grace of God, and will not be drawn with the Cords of his Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To perſwade you, that God will abundantly pardon; Conſider how valuable a Price was paid for your Redemption, that you might have Forgiveneſs. When you think of the Freeneſs of this Mercy to you, think alſo that it coſt the precious Blood of Jeſus to Procure it. And by the great Propitiation for Sin, which he hath made, God hath glorify'd his Holineſs and Juſtice, and may now glorifie his Mercy and Grace, in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106979:33"/>pardoning and ſaving Sinners, without leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Honour of his Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or impeaching any of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and Perfections. You may come, and beg Mercy for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <q>Lord, ſave me, for thy Mercy's ſake, I am a Vile Sinner, a Rebellious Creature, not only an unprofitable Servant, but a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Criminal: I have nothing in my ſelf, but Matter of Shame, and Humiliation; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any good, but what thou haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me. There's nothing in any of my Services, but need the Sprinkling of the Blood of Jeſus, to make them accepted. But there is Redemption, even the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sin through the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. <hi>Lord,</hi> Here is the Blood ſhed for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of my Sins: <hi>Lord,</hi> Here's the Price paid for my Reconciliation, here's a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs to cover me, here's a compleat, Attoning Sacrifice, Chriſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Righteouſneſs, and Interceſſion, and Grace can ſave me. O let me be found in him, accepted in him! Did I diſhonour God formerly, by my aggravated Sins? Chriſt my Redeemer hath honour'd him more by his Death, than ever I diſhonour'd him by my wicked Life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not a Trouble to you, to think with what Affection and Delight you ſinned, with what Deliberation you committed ſuch and ſuch Sins? Oh! remember that Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106979:33"/>to do the Mediatorial Will of his Father: He was ſtraitned 'till he drank of the bitter Cup, and was baptized with his own Blood. He knew before hand, all that he was to do and ſuffer for our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet willingly undertook it: Did you ſin with much intenſeneſs of Spirit, ſo that your Heart was in it? Have your Crimes been (many of them) Mental, Spiritual, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sins? (like thoſe of the Devil, which are worſe than Senſual, Carnal Ones) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Chriſt's Sufferings lay much in his <hi>Soul</hi> alſo. His Spirit, his Soul was heavy unto Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whatever Unworthineſs you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend of the Mercy offer'd you, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 'tis <hi>Free Mercy.</hi> You are call'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to receive it, without Money and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Price. If you are weary and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and ſenſible of your Unworthineſs; if you ſee your need of his help, are deſirous of it, and willing to yield your ſelves to his Conduct; to be ſaved in a way of Free-grace, ſo as to give him the entire Glory of your Salvation; you ought to believe that God will ſhow you Mercy, and abundantly pardon you. He hath glorify'd his Mercy in the purchaſe of Forgiveneſs by Chriſt, in the Publication of it in the Goſpel, and in the Application of it to particular Sinners upon <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> or Repentance and Faith; (I ſcruple not to put <hi>either</hi> firſt.)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106979:34"/>ſince they are inſeperable, and are never parted: And both are abſolutely needful. Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that at once we may give God the Honour of his Authority and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Law, by our Repentance; and of his rich Grace in the Goſpel, by our Faith in Chriſt. And can any thing be <hi>more free</hi> to us, than to be forgiven, in this Method, on theſe Terms? to have all our Tranſgreſſions blotted out for his Name's ſake? and to be waſhed and cleans'd in the Fountain of Chriſt's Blood, when we have nothing but our own miſerable, and wretched Caſe to move his Pity? He juſtiſies us freely by his Grace, and found a way to do it, with Honour to his own Name. What a ſtrange Paſſage is that of the Prophet? <hi>Iſa.</hi> XLIII. 22, 23, 24. <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me, O Jacob, but haſt been weary of me, O Iſrael, thou haſt not brought me the ſmall Cattle of thy burnt Offerings, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haſt thou honour'd me with thy Sacrifice; thou haſt bought me no ſweet Cane with Money, neither haſt thou filled me with the fat of thy Sacrifices, but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thine Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> What might now be expected, but that God ſhould ſay, Therfore I will not hear thee when thou calleſt, I'le make thee a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to my Wrath, I'le puniſh thee accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy Deſert: But 'tis quite otherwiſe, for it follows in <hi>Verſe</hi> 25. <hi>I, even I, am he,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106979:34"/>that blotteh out thy Tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy Sins.</hi> When the God whom we had offended by Sin, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a God of Forgiveneſs, in ſuch a way and method of rich and glorious Grace, we need not doubt but his Heart is in it, and therfore that he will abundantly pardon. He might have exacted the Puniſhment of Sin, when he gave his only begotten Son, to be a Propitiation for our Sin, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his Suffering inſtead of ours. There could be nothing move him to this, but his own Grace and Love: And therfore we ought to believe, that he's ready to receive returning Sinners unto Mercy for Chriſt's ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> As conſequent to this, Conſider, that by believing, that God will abundantly pardon returning Sinners, we give Honour and Glory to God. He is pleas'd and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd by our giving Credit to his Word, and hoping in his Mercy. Whereas if we diſtruſt his Promiſes, and Declarations of Grace, we not only diſobey his Order, but refuſe that which he delights in, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he's glorify'd. By not believing his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Pardon, we do what we can to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Command of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and the Promſe of Salvation by him. Yea, to diſappoint the great Deſign of Chriſt's Coming into the World, which was to ſave Sinners. We undervalue the rich Proviſion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106979:35"/>he hath made for our Encouragement; we gratifie the Devil, in keeping off from the only Remedy which Chriſt hath procured: We do in effect make God a Liar, by disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the Record he hath given of his Son, not ſetting to our Seal that God is true, 1 <hi>John</hi> V. 10. <hi>John</hi> III. 33. If we honour and pleaſe God by our Faith and Hope, more than by any thing elſe; we do as much diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diſpleaſe him by our Unbelieving Deſpondency, and Diſpair. Yea, all the Sins of your paſt Life, that make you fear God will never forgive you, are not cloathed with higher Aggravations of Guilt, than your doubting of the pardon of them, in Caſe you unfeignedly return to God, and believe in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> You ought to believe it for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon added, <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. becauſe <hi>God's Thoughts are not as ours;</hi> but as far as the Heavens are above the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We can't think ſo kindly of any, who have injur'd us: as God thinks of us who have offended him. Nor can we think to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree God is able to forgive our greateſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, and ſhow Mercy to the vileſt Sinners, that will return. We are prone to revenge, we are hardly reconciled; we are apt to return Evil for Evil; we are not eaſily brought to Forgiveneſs. But <hi>My thoughts are not as yours,</hi> (ſaith God) <q>You know not how far my Mercy can
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106979:35"/>reach, I am God and not Man. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between God and Man, between the Creature and Creator, is infinitely more than between Heaven and Earth. What if you can't imagine, that ever I ſhould have ſuch Thoughts of Mercy for poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: Do you conſider, how high the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are above the Earth? ſo are my Thoughts and Ways higher than yours: They are like my ſelf, <hi>infinite.</hi>

He hath embrac'd me in his ſuſtaining, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory Arms, when he might have ſpurn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my guilty Soul to Hell, and ſaid, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me thou Worker of Iniquity,

When I had ſinned againſt Light, when I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted Conſcience, when I had frequently and wilfully injured Love, I thought he would never have forgotten it: But the greatneſs of his Love and Mercy, and the Blood and Interceſſion of his Son hath can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled all. O how many Mercies have I taſted, ſince I thought I had ſinned away all Mercies! How patiently hath he born with me, ſince I thought he would never have put up more? — Tho' I injure and diſhonour him by loving him no more, tho' I oft forget him, and have been out of the Way, when he hath come or called me; tho' I have diſobediently turned away mine Ears, and unkindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd the Entertainments of his Love; and unfaithfully play'd with thoſe, whoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he forbad me; yet he hath not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorc'd me, or turn'd me out of Doors. O wonderful! that Heaven will be familiar with Earth! and God with Man! the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with a Worm! and the moſt Holy with an unconſtant Sinner! Man refuſeth me, when God will entertain me: Thoſe whom I never wrong'd, reject me with Reproach; and God whom I have unſpeakably inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, doth invite me, entreat me, and

Men that I have deſerved well of, abhor me; and God that I have deſerved Hell of, doth accept me. I upbraid my ſelf with my ſins, but he doth not upbraid me with them. I condemn my ſelf for them, but he condemns me not, I have Peace with him, before I can have Peace with my Conſcience.</q>

               <hi>Object.</hi> But after all theſe endearing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the Grace of God, (may ſome ſay) we can't tell how to believe, <hi>'tis hard to be fully perſwaded of this.</hi> Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Verſes following the Text, where there's this Objection obviated. You ſay, you can't have your Hearts duely affected with theſe Declarations of God's Grace, you can't be brought to accept this Mercy, to cloſe with this Offer, to be encouraged by ſuch a Promiſe and truſt in it: It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore added, as directly ſuitable to ſuch a Caſe, <hi>Verſes</hi> 10, 11. <hi>As the Rain cometh down, and the Snow from Heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give Seed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater. So ſhall my word be, that goeth forth out of my Mouth; it ſhall not return unto me void, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, it ſhall proſper in the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I ſent it.</hi> That is, As the Heavens do not give Light and Heat, and Snow in vain;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106979:37"/>but cauſe a promiſing Spring, and a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Harveſt: So, ſaith God, my Thoughts of Grace, manifeſted by my Declarations of Mercy, and Promiſes of Forgiveneſs, ſhall have Efficacy and Influence to make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; to enable you to hope and truſt in my Mercy; and ſo to be quiet and ſatisfy'd, that your great and hainous Sins ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given. The very Publication of this Grace, ſhall be attended with a Power to bring Souls to believe it. <hi>I know my Thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you, are Thoughts of Peace, and not of Evil;</hi> to give you a gracious End, and raiſe your Expectations of it, and they ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be fulfilled. The Declarations of this Mercy ſhall be credited, my Word of Grace ſhall not be <hi>in vain;</hi> it ſhall take hold of dejected, deſpairing Souls, and raiſe them to Faith and Hope. 'Tis with this Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement we publiſh the glad Tydings of Salvation, and invite Sinners to return to God by Jeſus Chriſt, with an Aſſurance of finding Mercy. I ſay, 'tis with this Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we beſeech them to be reconcil'd to God, and aſſure 'em that he's ready to forgive: 'Tis in Hope, that by the Spirit accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Declaration of the Word, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Forgiveneſs with God, many Souls might be attracted and won, perſwaded and overcome, and ſo prevail'd with to return to God, and believe the glorious Riches, Freeneſs and Abundance of his Mercy. God
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106979:37"/>grant we may find more and more, ſuch fruits of preaching the Goſpel. On the other hand, I beſeech you take heed, how you turn your Backs on this Mercy of God, and the Offer of it: Beware how you ſhut your Ears againſt his gracious Invitation, when he thus proclaims and publiſhes his Readineſs to forgive. Take heed how you go on in Sin, after God freely tenders you the Forgiveneſs of all your Sins, if you will return. With the greateſt Seriouſneſs I muſt tell you, that one ſuch Sermon of God's forgiving Grace and Mercy, rejected, ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and miſimprov'd, may be of more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſequence to the Souls of thoſe that hear it, and make light of it, than I am able to expreſs.</p>

Never any Sermon about it ſhall ever do you good more. <hi>But I am God and not Man, my Thoughts and Ways are not as yours.</hi> I invite you again, I beſeech you turn and live, do not go on and dye.</q> God ſpeaks this Language to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you, the worſt of you, who hear me this Day.</p>

After this, for a poor, proud Sinner, to turn his Back upon this Grace of God, to ſcorn this Saviour, and diſdain to be ſaved by him; ſaying in Effect, I will have none of your Chriſt, none of his Grace, none of his Mercy: I had rather enjoy my Luſts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in my Sin, and put it to the Venture; how provoking is ſuch Guilt? and how righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous will be the Condemnation of ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Sinners?</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Apply your ſelf therfore to God in Chriſt, by Earneſt Prayer. He hath the Words of Eternal Life, he is a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance as well as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. The Spirit of Faith, is the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; he can open thy blind Eyes, and ſoften thy hard Heart; he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Cripple to take up his Bed and walk, at the ſame time gave him Power to obey. There is a Divine Spirit and Power, even the Spirit of Life and Power in Chriſt Jeſus, that accompanies the Preaching of the Goſpel; this may be hoped for, this ought to be valu'd, deſir'd and begg'd. You ought never to deſpair of God's Grace, to enable you to believe, when it continues to be your Duty to believe on Chriſt; and it cannot but continue to be ſo, unleſs the Goſpel be repeal'd. Therefore beg with all your Hearts, that you may be enabled to look to him, and be ſaved; to come to him, and find Reſt to your Souls; to believe on him, and receive Remiſſion of Sins. For by beholding the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in the Face of Chriſt, you may be changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory.</p>
               <p>Beg an Underſtanding to know him that is true, and with all your Hearts to believe on him, that you may aſſent to his Word, conſent to his Covenant, reſign to his Will, and truſt in his Promiſe, depending on his

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If you begin to find the Spirit of Chriſt breathing on your Souls, that have been yet unperſwaded; if you have any Motions of the good Spirit of God, by the preaching the Word, or by any other means, take heed you thankfully cheriſh and entertain them. When you find your Souls begin to turn towards Chriſt, if you find any Beams of Heavenly Light break in upon you; any Inclinations ſtarted of applying to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to obey the Voice of his Spirit. Open every Door of your Souls to receive his Light. When he works any Conviction of Sin, any ſence of your need of a Saviour, any Deſires after him, or Purpoſes of Heart to leave your Sins, and give up your ſelves to God, to be ſaved by Chriſt, according to the Goſpel; for your Souls ſake encourage ſuch Thoughts, cheriſh ſuch Suggeſtions. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how you turn them off, but preſently and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106979:40"/>thankfully ſtrike in, ſaying, <q>Lord, I yield, I am overcome; I have long enough, and too long refus'd thy Grace, diſobey'd thy Will, and reſiſted thy Spirit. Thou haſt often knockt, and I would not open; O <hi>now</hi> enter thou Bleſſed of the Lord, and take Poſſeſſion of my Soul! Let Chriſt dwell in my Heart by Faith, and his Spirit form a Temple there, and reſide there as in his own Dwelling for ever. Lord, art thou yet willing, (after all my Provocations) to ſhow Mercy, and abundantly to pardon? Willing to be my God and my Saviour? Bleſſed be God, I am now willing to be thy Servant. Thy powerful Grace hath made me willing: Thy Spirit open'd my Eyes to ſee my ſelf undone, to ſee that Chriſt is able and willing to ſave me; I hope, I am now ready to receive him, willing to embrace him as <hi>Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</hi> I come to thee, O God, as to the Fountain of Life, to be quickned and cleans'd, to be waſh'd, juſtify'd, ſanctify'd and ſav'd from Sin and Hell, by the Blood and Spirit of Jeſus, through the Free Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Grace of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But to Conclude, If after all, there be any Such here as are not, will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to forſake their Evil Ways, and turn to God in Chriſt; Let them conſider, that the longer they continue in their Obſtinacy
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:106979:40"/>and Unbelief, under the preaching of the glorious Grace and Mercy of God to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo much the more Danger they are in of being loſt for ever. For their Minds muſt needs be more blinded by ſinning againſt the Light: Their Hearts more hardned, by miſimproving that which ſhould have ſoftned them: The Power of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is weakned, after ſo many Struglings and Combates, that they muſt needs have had with their own Conſciences; after ſo many Conteſts between Corruption and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, between Truth in the Mind, and Corrupt Inclinations in the Heart. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if they have formerly been awakned, and there have been ſome Fears and Hopes, with good Deſires, and other Affections for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſtirr'd; if by the Common Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Holy Spirit, they have had ſome ſerious Concern about their Salvation, and all this is worn off and gone; the Caſe of ſuch is very bad, and their Recovery the leſs hopeful; becauſe their Repentance is the more unlikely. And if they perſiſt, their Doom will be intolerable. But it is to prevent this, as to thoſe who may be in ſuch a dangerous Caſe, that I thus ſpeak. And therefore I moſt earneſtly invite, beſeech and entreat them; however Wicked and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous they have been, not to make light of this further Offer of the Grace of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106979:41"/>Goſpel: And that by no means, they would deſpair of finding <hi>Mercy</hi> with God; even <hi>Now,</hi> if they will Return to him with all their Hearts, whatever their paſt Sins have been. If <hi>Now</hi> they will return, God will <hi>abundantly pardon: For his Thoughts are not as ours,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, and the Unrighteous Man his Thoughts, and let him Return unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly Pardon.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN Two former Diſcourſes, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd this double Precept, or Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Duty, which concerns Sinners of all ſorts; under the two Names of <hi>Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous,</hi> that they muſt <hi>forſake their Evil Ways and Thoughts; and return to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106979:42"/>the Lord,</hi> which are the two parts of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance. I have alſo conſider'd the encouraging Promiſe, that thereupon God will <hi>have Mercy,</hi> and will <hi>abundantly Pardon.</hi> And I have now to conſider, what <hi>Ground</hi> we have to believe this: Becauſe <hi>God's Thoughts are not as ours, nor his Ways as ours,</hi> &amp;c. But there remains ſomething of the <hi>Application</hi> of the Second General, That if the Wicked forſake their evil Ways and Thoughts, and return to God; he will not only forgive, but <hi>He will abundantly pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE.</hi> Be thankful to Heaven for this good News; that God will thus mercifully treat returning Sinners. He might have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on the Terms of the violated, firſt Covenant, to the Ruine of all Mankind: He might have left us, as the fallen Angels, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Propoſal, Promiſe, or Offer of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: <hi>But God ſo loved the World, that he gave his Son, that whoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we think of the Caſe of the fallen Angels, who are reſerv'd in Chains of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Judgment of the Great Day, and compare it with our own, who have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of Mercy and Grace by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; we have Reaſon to adore the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Goodneſs of God to us. If a few poor, inconſiderable People in a Kingdom, of the meaneſt ſort; ſhould be found guilty of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106979:42"/>Treaſon againſt a Prince; when there are Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Nobility and Gentry, who have likewiſe rebell'd againſt him; and a Pardon ſhould be offer'd to thoſe of the poorer, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort; while the Nobles and Great Men are all Executed, and not a Man of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to Mercy; would not this be Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Goodneſs to the others? Eſpecially if thoſe Great Men, the Principal Subjects of the Kingdom, were Condemn'd for <hi>one Offence,</hi> for one Act of Treaſon; and the others forgiven <hi>many Tranſgreſſions,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to Favour and Honour, after many Years of Rebellion. You eaſily know how to apply it.</p>
            <p>How thankful ought we to be, that we are not left in the remedileſs Condition of Devils? that there is a Sacrifice offer'd for Sin, a full Attonement made, a ſufficient Price paid, a Fountain open'd, a new and living Way, for God to be glorify'd in the Forgiveneſs and Salvation of Returning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that believe on his Son. It is matter of Continual Admiration, and Thankful Praiſe, that we have Forgiveneſs this way. Can we have a fuller Evidence of the Evil and Malignity of Sin, or of God's Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt it? and conſequently of the Worth and Value of a Pardon; than by the Sufferings, Blood and Sacrifice of Chriſt? And what ſtronger Proof, or clearer Evidence of God's Readineſs to forgive Sin, than the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106979:43"/>giving of his Son to dye for our Sins, to cleanſe us from <hi>all Sin;</hi> even the moſt hainous, grievous Offences: Becauſe his Mercy through the Mediator is greater than the Sins of the whole World.</p>
            <p>Let us with Hearty Thankfulneſs adore him, for this glorious Myſtery of his Love and Grace: And that we may be Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful indeed, let us apply it to our ſelves in particular. Let us think of our own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Caſe under the Guilt of Sin, and the Curſe of God. Let us think of the many thouſand Talents we owe, without being able to pay one Farthing; of the Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Crimes we are guilty of; and that the Wages of every one is Death: And that all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth could not procure the Forgiveneſs of one ſinful Thought. If you think you have, or ever had any ſerious ſenſe of the Evil of Sin, and your loſt undone Condition as Sinners, how thankfully ſhould you receive theſe glad Tydings of Mercy, by Jeſus Chriſt? But if you have gone further, and have actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Attonement; if you are brought under the Bond of the Covenant; if you are united to Chriſt by Faith, and ſo intereſted in the ſure Mercies of <hi>David;</hi> and by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs deliver'd from Condemnation, what <hi>Special Thankfulneſs</hi> is due from ſuch? When there are comparatively ſo Few, to whom the Goſpel is preached, but do receive this
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:106979:43"/>Grace of God in vain? <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> Who, and what am I, that I ſhould have good hope through Grace, of the Forgiveneſs of my Sins? <hi>of mine,</hi> that have been more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated than the Sins of Others: When O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not greater Sinners, (it may be, not ſo bad) ſhall periſh for ever; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven: When it may be, ſome of my Companions, and Accomplices in Sin, are cut off by Death, without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Pardon! Were not Others call'd, and invited as well as I? But he hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd mine Ears, and Heart, to receive him; and ſo hath pardon'd me, while others are condemned. O Admirable, and Aſtoniſhing Grace!</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take heed of abuſing this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Grace to the worſt of Sinners.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As any Countenance to Sin, or Encouragement to continue in it: <hi>Shall we ſin,</hi> becauſe God is ready to forgive Sin; <hi>that his Grace may abound? God forbid;</hi> Rom. VI. 1. Far be it from us, let it be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred Thought. 'Tis needful to mention this, becauſe in many Inſtances, the moſt pure and holy Doctrine may be perverted to patronize Sin. We read, that the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Courſe of Nature, was made a ground of Truſt by the Pſalmiſt, as an Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Evidence and Inſtance of his Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Truth. <hi>Pſalm</hi> CXIX. 89. <hi>Thy Word is ſettled in the Heavens, and thy Faithfulneſs
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106979:44"/>to all Generations.</hi> And yet ſome Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally abus'd it; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> III. 4. ſaying, <hi>All things continue as they were: Where is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his Coming?</hi> The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The Time is ſhort, and the Faſhion of the World paſſeth away;</hi> therfore, let them that have ſuch and ſuch Relations, Poſſeſſions, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the World, carry it as if they had none. Whil'ſt others abuſe this, and ſay; the Time is ſhort, <hi>Let us cat and drink, for to morrow we may dye.</hi> So here, God is ready to ſhow Mercy to returning Sinners, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way,</hi> &amp;c. Others turn this Grace of God into Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and will venture the more boldly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sin, becauſe God is ready to forgive. <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John) I write unto you, that ye ſin not. But if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father.</hi> There's a vaſt difference between the Remiſſion of Sins paſt, and an Allowance of Sin for the future. We may take Comfort in the abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace of God, and his Readineſs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give; though we muſt dread the Thought of venturing on Sin, that his Grace may abound in the Forgiveneſs of it. This is contrary to all Gratitude and Ingenuity; and to the true Nature of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And there can hardly be a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Symptom of damnable Ungodlineſs, than for any to preſume to ſin upon this Conſideration; <hi>That they hope they ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:106979:44"/>The Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 4. ſpeaks of ſome ſuch, <hi>Who turn the Grace of God into Wantonneſs, denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and he ſaith of them, that <hi>They were ordain'd of old to Condemnation:</hi> For the Grace of God that brings Salvation, ought to teach us to deny Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſinning againſt God, becauſe he will abundantly pardon, is in ſome reſpects more Aggravated than the Sin of <hi>Devils,</hi> who will curſe God, and fly in his Face; becauſe there's no hope of Pardon. But God offers Pardon to you, and declares that he is ready to forgive. And will you dare to ſin the more? If ever you are awakened to a Senſe of Sin, this of all others will be moſt likely to ſink you into Deſpair; that you ventur'd to ſin in hopes of Pardon. For what can relieve a convinced, awakned Soul, but the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of God in the Forgiveneſs of Sin? Whereas ſuch a One may ſay, <hi>Lord,</hi> this very Mercy I have abus'd, I have ſinn'd the more becauſe of this Grace. And if we ſhould mention to ſuch a one, the Inſtances of <hi>Manaſſeh, Paul,</hi> &amp;c. who after great Sins were pardoned; he will be ready to reply, that they never ſinned in hope of Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or turn'd the Grace of God into Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, as I have done.</p>
            <p>There's Forgiveneſs with God, <hi>that he may be fear'd,</hi> ſerved, loved and obey'd.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106979:45"/>But will any ſay, there's Forgiveneſs with God, that he may be ſlighted and neglected, rebell'd againſt, and diſobey'd? His abuſed Goodneſs will turn to the more intollerable Wrath, againſt all ſuch as preſume on his Mercy; apprehending that they ſhall find an Eaſie Pardon, tho' they continue in their Sins. 'Tis to ſin againſt the very Nature and End of God's Grace; to cut off their own Plea for it, and the general Ground of their Hope in it. 'Tis without a Promiſe, and againſt a Threatning, for any to expect For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, if they wilfully continue in ſin: 'Tis to pervert the whole Goſpel, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God will juſtifie the Ungodly, while they remain in their <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs.</hi> Is not Unbelief a part of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> as contrary to the moſt expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. of God to believe on his Son? If ever God ſhow Mercy unto any, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon them; he always gives them <hi>Repentance</hi> unto Life, and <hi>Faith</hi> unfeigned.</p>
            <p>And let ſuch remember, that as God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth Mercy and Forgiveneſs to Returning Sinners, and that his Thoughts are far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ours, as Heaven above the Earth in this Matter; ſo his Thoughts of Anger, Wrath and Fury, againſt Obſtinate, Wilful, Preſumptuous, Impenitent Sinners, are alſo above our Thoughts, as far as the Heavens are above the Earth. <hi>He will tear in pieces, and none ſhall deliver; he that made them will
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106979:45"/>ſhow them no mercy; and who knows the power of his Anger? he will laugh at their Calamity, and mock when their fear cometh. He will wound the head of his Enemies, and the hairy Scalp of ſuch a one that goes on ſtill in his Treſpaſſes,</hi> Pſal. LXVIII. 21. Prov. I. <hi>latter end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take heed of abuſing this Doctrine of God's Grace, by admitting ſlight Thoughts of Sin, ſo as to encourage you to <hi>delay</hi> ſeeking after Forgiveneſs; or to ſeek and expect it <hi>any other way,</hi> but only through Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As to the Matter of <hi>Delay,</hi> the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Life, and the Uncertainty of God's giving Grace <hi>hereafter,</hi> to them that refuſe it <hi>now,</hi> is ſufficient to be ſaid here, if duly conſider'd. That which I now aim at, is to diſcourage any Hopes of obtaining Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God, but <hi>only</hi> through the Blood, Sacrifice, and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: There is no other Saviour, no other Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and Man. If ever you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to God, and find Mercy with him, it muſt be through Jeſus Chriſt. The Way and Method is fixt, and publiſh'd, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd to be unalterable: There is no other Name under Heaven, but <hi>his,</hi> by which any Man can be ſaved: If God be gracious to any, and deliver them from going down to the Pit, 'tis becauſe he hath found a Ranſom, <hi>Job</hi> XXXIII. 24.</p>
            <p>The Abſolute Mercy of God is not to be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106979:46"/>reſted in; for he hath told us in what Way and Method he will diſpence his Mercy; and how we ſhall partake of it: That we muſt honour the Son, as we honour the Father; receive him as Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, the only Mediator between God and Man; and that <hi>If we believe not that Jeſus is he, we muſt dye in our Sins.</hi> 'Tis not enough to ceaſe to do Evil, and make Reſtitution where you have injur'd and wrong'd any, (which yet is a neceſſary Fruit of Repentance;) 'Tis not a little outward Reformation, or the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſome Duties of Religious Worſhip, that before were neglected, that will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, if you overlook <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and lay the ſtreſs of your Hope, for Acceptance with God, on any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould faſt, and pray, and weep, and mourn, and wear Sackcloath, and give all you have to the Poor, and continue a Life of Auſterity and Mortification for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years; this will not avail, if you think to pacifie God herewith, and ſubſtitute this in the room of the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in order to Forgiveneſs. You will but provoke God, and diſhonour the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and deceive your own Souls. 'Tis certain, we are naturally prone to fix upon ſome other Bottom, enclin'd to eſtabliſh a Righteouſneſs of our own, inſtead of Chriſt Jeſus, and his Righteouſneſs. But we can never be ſecure from the Charge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106979:46"/>Law, and the Challenge of Divine Juſtice, but by being united to Chriſt, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in him, found in him, and accepted with God on his Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SE</hi> III. Let me beſeech you to pity thoſe Sinners, who are not return'd to God, and intereſted in his pardoning Mercy; and to pity ſuch, as deſiring and endeavouring to return, do yet apprehend and fear, that they ſhall never be pardon'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to thoſe as are yet under the Guilt of Sin, and are not return'd to God, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in his pardoning Mercy: Conſider their Miſerable Caſe, and pity them: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If they are not Partakers of ths abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Pardon, there's <hi>no one ſin</hi> that they were ever guilty of, that is forgiven. Without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, (which includes forſaking our Evil Ways, and returning to God,) there's no For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of any Sin: Tho' Temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have ſometimes been diverted upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Humiliation, no one Sin is blotted out, but through the Blood of Chriſt, who is exalted to be a Prince and Saviour, to give <hi>Repentance</hi> as well as <hi>Remiſſion of Sins:</hi> And theſe are never to be parted. Therfore if any have liv'd twenty, thirty, or forty Years in the World, or longer, whenever God comes to enter into Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with you, all the Sins of your paſt Life, with all their ſeveral Aggravations, will be found in the Indictment, and charg'd againſt you: You are under the Guilt of them <hi>all;</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:106979:47"/>as much as if they were committed yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. As God's pardoning Mercy reaches to all the unknown, and forgotten Sins of true Penitents, as well as thoſe which they actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remember, and repent of, ſo where he doth not forgive <hi>all,</hi> he forgives <hi>none.</hi> And if the Guilt of <hi>one ſin</hi> be enough to ſink thee into Hell; what is it to have Ten Thouſand to anſwer for? If you can't ſtand in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when accuſed but for one ſinful Thought or Word, what will become of you, when you have all the numberleſs Tranſgreſſions of your paſt Lives to anſwer for?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider, that 'till ſin be forgiven, the Guilt of every unpardon'd Sinner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes every day. The longer he lives, he is ſtill heaping up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath. Upon every failure of our Duty to God or Man, there's a Debt of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſulting from it; and every New Sin is a Figure added to the Old Score. The longer therfore any one lives in an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd State, the more Guilt he contracts, and the more Crimes he has to Anſwer for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Conſider, that upon this Account, 'till we are intereſted in the pardoning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God; we are under the Curſe and Condemnation of the Law. Whatever Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages a Man may enjoy above Others, whatever Gifts, Reputation, Proſperity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he's ſtill under a Divine Curſe; he's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd already; and if he dye in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106979:47"/>he muſt periſh for ever. And how ſoon may Death put a Period to all thy Hopes of Forgiveneſs? In the mean time you are under <hi>a Divine Curſe,</hi> that reaches to all you have, and all you enjoy: In Health and Sickneſs, Proſperity and Adverſity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you go, and whatever you do. You pleaſe God in nothing; but abuſe his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and are liable every Moment to his Wrath; and if you dye, that ſtroak of Death which ſeparates thy Soul from thy Body, will ſeparate thee from God and Heaven for ever.</p>
            <p>And this Curſe of God will be found to be <hi>Intolerable,</hi> as well as unavoidable. When God deals with Sinners, as a God of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, they ſhall not be ſo weak, as to be annihilated by his Wrath; or ſo ſtrong, as to reſiſt or avoid his Righteous Vengeance; and 'tis <hi>Everlaſting Wrath</hi> likewiſe: Without being now reconciled to God, and intereſted in his pardoning Mercy by Jeſus Chriſt, the Wrath of God abideth on you; and will for ever abide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let me add one Conſideration more, to raiſe your Pity to Unpardon'd Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that is, their preſent deplorable Caſe, by the Accuſations of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For ſooner or later a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will ſpeak: Eſpecially as to thoſe that live under the Preaching of the Goſpel. <hi>The Sinners in Zion ſhall be afraid, Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106979:48"/>ſhall ſurprize the Hypocrite:</hi> They may try various Methods to ſtop the Mouth of Conſcience, by the Noiſe and Clatter, and Hurry of Worldly Buſineſs; they may think to forget their Miſery, and patch up a kind of Peace for a little while; but this is a falſe Peace, that if not ſpeedily broken, will end in Everlaſting Anguiſh: And if it be, (as a thouſand to one but it will be,) what Trembling, Horror, and Deſpair muſt be expected? How low will ſuch ſink; when they awake out of their Security? How will they roar and cry out under the Terrors of the Lord? How bitterly will they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Burden of Sin, as a Mountain on their Backs? Of the Wounds of Sin, as ſo many poyſon'd Arrows in their Hearts? How will their Joynts tremble, their Lips quiver, and their Hearts ake? When they ſhall ſee their Sins ſet in Order before them, and can't hope for Pardon? But whether they feel their Miſery or no, their Caſe is diſmal, for they do but dance about the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit, and the next Hour may tumble in. Conſcience may awake ſooner than you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and e're long it will. Conſcience, I ſay, which is an Accuſer, none can ſilence, a Judge that none can bribe. And if they will but give themſelves Time and Leiſure to think; a gloomy Darkneſs, like the Shadow of Death muſt now overſpread their Souls: They have no Relief, but by endeavouring not to think
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106979:48"/>of their Danger. Are not ſuch to be pity'd? O do what you can to awaken and ſave them!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There's another ſort, who need your Compaſſion, <hi>i. e.</hi> They who deſire and endeavour to return to God, and ſeek after Chriſt, but apprehend there is no Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for them. Tho' God will abundantly Pardon Others; they reckon <hi>they</hi> ſhall never be intereſted in his pardoning Mercy. They hear of God's multiplying Forgiveneſſes to Others; but dare not think, they ſhall have a Share in it. They read of a Saviour, but believe they ſhall never be ſav'd by him; they hardly dare look into the Bible, leſt they read their own Condemnation. All the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Things in the Scriptures againſt Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Unbelievers, againſt Apoſtates and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Sinners, they apply to themſelves. They dare not look into the Grave, nor think of dying, becauſe of what follows, in the ſinal Judgment of Chriſt, and the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Deſtruction of Sinners. If they had any former Peace, they reckon it was all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, Miſtake and Preſumption: For after all their Profeſſion, and Hearing, and Reading, and Praying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they tell you, <hi>They ſhall periſh,</hi> and be condemn'd as Hypocrites; and <hi>There's no Mercy for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O with what Bowels of Pity and Compaſſion, ſhould we conſider the Caſe of ſuch! And treat them with the Spirit of Meekneſs and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106979:49"/>
               <q>Chriſt is the Saviour of Sinners, but He is none of mine, (they ſay) for I heard his Goſpel Grace declared, but did not accept it; I outſtood my Day of Grace, and the Things of my Peace are hid from mine Eyes; He call'd me, but I would not come; and 'tis now too late. <hi>O 'tis now too late!</hi> He knock'd, and I would not open; and now the Door is ſhut againſt me. I am given up to a Hard Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> The very Thought of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the Happineſs of the Saints, doth but terrifie them, becauſe they think they have loſt it, and ſhall never come there: As well as the Thoughts of <hi>Hell,</hi> which they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon their Deſerved Portion, and that e're long it will be ſo. And that Word <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> Everlaſting Deſtruction, cuts them to the Heart. And well it may, if they believe it belongs to them; and that they ſhall fall under the condemning Sentence of the Judge, to paſs into Everlaſting Fire. And in ſeveral ſuch Caſes, the Devil ſtrikes in, and aggravates their Diſtreſs: He inſults over them; <q>What think ye now of Sin? Where's the Pleaſure and Advantage of it now? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hath been all your Praying, Hearing, attending on Ordinances, Coming to the Lord's Table, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You are fit indeed to come to the Lord's Table; you have come <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,</hi> you have ſeal'd your Damnation by it, you have eat and drank Judgment to your ſelves by it again and again.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:106979:49"/>
            <p> And ſuch is their Darkneſs and Perplexity, they know not what to Anſwer, but conclude <hi>They are loſt,</hi> and the Goſpel hid from them; that Chriſt is not their Freind, and will not be their Saviour. Some of them will tell you, they are as ſure of it, as if they were in Hell already. 'Tis as true, they ſay, as if they had heard his Condemning Sentence: He hath ſhut up his Bowels, and his Tender Mercy for ever from them: And there's nothing remains, but a fearful Looking for of Wrath, and Judgment, Tribulation, and Anguiſh: And that all their preſent Darkneſs, is but the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of Eternal Darkneſs: And what they feel now, is nothing to what they fear. And if they be in ſuch Agonies <hi>now,</hi> O what will it be to lye in the Flames of Hell? <hi>Wretched Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creatures!</hi> they know not how to live, and they dare not dye; leſt Death ſhould open the Door to Eternal Damnation. And theſe Fears are heighten'd, when ever they meet with thoſe Chriſtians, who have any Hopes of Heaven; becauſe they ſay, Chriſt ſaveth <hi>Others,</hi> but will not ſave <hi>them.</hi> Do not ſuch as theſe deſerve our Compaſſion? (And there be many ſuch in this City.) Though Natural Melancholy, and Bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition give ſome Occaſion, at leaſt to heighten ſuch Terrors and Diſtreſs in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral; yet the ſenſe of paſt Guilt, and the Temptations of Satan muſt not be overlookt. What I have to ſay on the Third General,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106979:50"/>of <hi>God's Thoughts not</hi> being as <hi>ours,</hi> will be ſuitable to their Caſe.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to that, let me mention ſomething for the <hi>Tryal,</hi> and <hi>Examination</hi> of our ſelves, whether we are intereſted in this Forgiveneſs or no?</p>
            <p>Would you know whether your Sins are forgiven, whether you are intereſted in this Promiſe of multiply'd Pardon? Conſider in the General, and Examine your <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts II. 21.
<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Sermons of the <hi>Forgiveneſs of Sin,</hi> by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> 8vo. Where the whole Doctrine of Pardon is more accurately laid down.</note> The Eſſential Acts of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> are, Godly. Sorrow for all our known Sins; and a ſincere Purpoſe of Heart, to turn from all Sin to God; with Anſwerable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of Univerſal Holineſs. The three Acts of ſaving <hi>Faith in Chriſt</hi> are, (1.) An Aſſent of the Mind to Scripture-Revelation, concerning Chriſt. (2.) The Conſent of the Soul, embracing and receiving him upon his own Terms. (3.) A Relyance and Truſt on him for Pardon of Sin, and Eternal Life. More particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">I. You may Conſider your <hi>Repentance,</hi> and enquire how you ſtand affected to Sin? Have you been under any deep Conviction of the Evil of Sin, as to cauſe not only ſome Sorrow but Hatred and Deteſtation of it? Have you
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106979:50"/>ſeen your ſelves loſt and undone by reaſon of Guilt, ſo as abſolutely to need pardoning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? Is the Heart of Stone taken away, and a Heart of Fleſh given? What Humiliation for Sin, and Self-abaſement in the Apprehenſion of your Vileneſs, have you ever had? Have you been diſquieted and burden'd under the Senſe of Sin, ſo as to condemn your ſelves; and ſee that you are loſt without the Free-Mercy of God in Chriſt? Owning the Righteouſneſs of God, if he ſhould caſt you off; and yet looking up to God through Jeſus Chriſt with Hope? 'Tis true, there is a great Difference in the Expreſſions of Sorrow and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Sin, which ſome make beyond others; but all are made to ſee the Evil of Sin, ſo as to be cur'd of the Love of it; to humble themſelves, and acknowledge their Vileneſs.</p>
            <p>Have you thereupon been brought to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous <hi>Confeſſion of Sin,</hi> Pſal. XXXVIII. 18. with Earneſt Prayers to God for Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when you remember the peculiar Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of many of your Crimes? How long continued in, againſt how many Helps, and Warnings, Calls, and Counſels, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to the contrary? How ſmall the Temptation, how frequent the Repetition; and yet how much Wilfulneſs, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the various Methods of God's Grace and Providence to reclaim you? Such a Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot long be conceal'd and hid. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106979:51"/>therfore, what Effects it hath had, to bring you into the Preſence of God, there to confeſs and bewail your Folly? O what a Beaſt, what a Fool, what a Wretch have I been, thus and thus have I ſinn'd againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? How low ſhould I abaſe my ſelf in the Preſence of God? How unworthy am I to lift up mine Eyes to the Throne of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? How wonderful is his Patience, that I am yet alive?</p>
            <p>If you have a ſerious Senſe of Sin, you will not be able to keep Silence; for that is contrary to the Confeſſion of Sin, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Pſal.</hi> XXXII. 5. <hi>I acknowledg'd my Sin unto thee, and mine Iniquity have I not hid.</hi> While he kept ſilence, or did not confeſs his Sin, his Bones were vex'd, his Heart was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted. But upon a free and full Confeſſion to God, his Spirit was calm'd, and he could look through his Penitential Tears, with Hope to God's Mercy-Seat. God requires this Confeſſion in order to Forgiveneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> III. 12, 13. <hi>Return, O backſliding Iſrael, ſaith the Lord, and I will not cauſe mine Anger to fall upon you, for I am merciful, ſaith the Lord, only acknowledge thine Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>if we confeſs our ſin,</hi> (the Apoſtle tells us) <hi>God is faithful and juſt to forgive them,</hi> 1 John I. 9. And the more free and particular we are in our Confeſſion of Sin to God, ſo much the better. This cannot be without a Holy Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Shame, in the Remembrance of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:106979:51"/>your paſt Folly, your Sinfulneſs and Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your Ingratitude and Rebellion againſt God, and not meerly upon the Account of any Penal, Afflictive Conſequences, by which you have ſmarted. For Godly Sorrow will diſtinguiſh it ſelf by the Principles and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of it, to be another thing, than meerly bowing down the Head under the Burthen of Affliction. There will be a Holy Shame and Confuſion of Face, in the ſenſe of what you have done, and what you have deſerv'd; ſo as to tremble at the Thought of committing the like Sins again; and to fear the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that might draw you to it; and make you reckon every Burden of Affliction tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in compariſon of the Burden of Sin. Conſidering what we have done, and againſt whom we have ſinned: Conſidering what a fooliſh Choice we have made, what Grace we have ſlighted; what Mercies we have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and how unworthily we have behaved our ſelves to God, our Owner, Maker and Sovereign; and unto Chriſt, our Saviour and Redeemer; and unto the Holy Spirit, who hath been ſtriving with us: Hereupon we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn our ſelves, and beg that God would not condemn us; we are made ſenſible of our Unworthineſs of the leaſt Favour; and as the Prodigal or Publican, beg free Mercy: Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Righteouſneſs, if he ſhould deny it. Thus judging our ſelves, we juſtifie God; and hereby give Glory to him.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:106979:52"/>
            <p> This will make his Mercy the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and our Prayers the more Earneſt. Such a Sence of Sin we muſt carefully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, to encreaſe our Hatred of it, Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to forfake it, and Endeavours againſt it for the future: To promote and preſerve Humility, and a low Eſteem of our ſelves, and entire Submiſſion to all the Word and Will of God: To help us to perform every Duty, and joyn in every Ordinance, with more Meekneſs and Self-abaſement; and to bear every Affliction as deſerving a thouſand times worſe than we ever yet ſuffer'd. This will make us feel more our need of Chriſt for Pardon, and ſanctifying Grace; and make us have daily Recourſe to him, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his Blood and Spirit: And it will make us ready upon any juſt Occaſion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our Sins to <hi>Men</hi> alſo, if it appear to be for the Honour of God, that we do ſo; this will make us more compaſſionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Others, who have fallen by Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This will raiſe our Thankfulneſs for every little <hi>Favour,</hi> for every beginning of <hi>Mercy,</hi> for every thing of <hi>Grace,</hi> that we do, or may receive from God: And cauſe us readily to embrace and welcome the Goſpel Diſcovery, and Revelation of God's Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin.</p>
            <p>This ſerious Conviction of our Guilt and Folly, will make us own our ſelves, <hi>the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Sinners,</hi> as knowing the ſpecial Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106979:52"/>of our own Sins beyond what we know of Others. I do not know as to other Men, their Advantages or Diſadvantages, Helps or Hindrances by Education, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Admonition, Counſel, Afflictions, and ſpecial Obligations, as I do my own. I do not know the Strength, the Urgency, the Importunity of their Temptations; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if I had the like, I might not have been as bad or worſe. I do not know the Force and Power of Bodily Conſtitution, inclining 'em ſtrongly to ſome Sins. I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Sins have been committed upon ſuch ſmall Temptations, as many of mine have been: Or whether againſt ſo many Motions of God's Spirit; or whether they continued ſo long without Repentance; or againſt ſo many Helps to repent. I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was ſo much of Wilfulneſs and Deliberation in Other Men's Sins; as I know there hath been in my own. I cannot tell, but as to other Mens Faults, there may be ſomething to leſſen, to extenuate, to mitigate their Guilt, that doth not appear: It may be, their Principles and Intentions were not ſo bad; and there was more of Infirmity, more of Miſtake and Error, more of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Surprize in their Sins, than I know there was in 'mine. I may hope they did it ignorantly, or but ſeldom; or that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is not ſo bad, as to God's Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the Miſchief done to others; I may
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106979:53"/>hope a great deal of what I hear of their Crimes may be falſe, or that God hath given them Repentance, tho' I know it not. And have Reaſon to conſider as to ſeveral, that they have otherwiſe many Excellent Qualifications, many Uſeful and Valuable Things in 'em, for which they ought to be eſteem'd. And ſo judging charitably of others, with ſerious Scrutiny into our ſelves, we ſhall ſee Reaſon to own our ſelves <hi>the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Sinners.</hi> Such an humble Senſe of our ſinful Vileneſs, is a part of true Repentance, and an Evidence of Forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We cannot ſuppoſe this, without <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of Sin,</hi> to which the Promiſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is made. If God hath forgiven you, he enables you by his Spirit to walk in his Ways, to ſtrive, and watch, and pray againſt thoſe Sins, which with a Godly Sorrow you have confeſs'd and bewail'd, ſo that you ſtand in Awe of God's Authority; and allow your ſelves in no wilful known Sin; or in any Negligent Omiſſions of poſitive, plain Duty; but endeavour to walk in all his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments blameleſs.</p>
            <p>However, becauſe of the Imperfection of this in the Beſt, Examine what Conflicts you have, what Oppoſition you make againſt Sin, by Renewed, Spiritual Principles. Is it the Deſire, Care and Endeavour of your Souls, to have the Power of Indwelling Sin weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106979:53"/>and the Habits of Grace ſtrengthned, and your Obedience more Uniform? Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to grow in Grace, eſpecially in that Grace which is contrary to your particular Sin and Corruption? Is there an Earneſt Deſire, and Conſtant Reſolution, and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bring forth Fruits worthy of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? <hi>The Wicked muſt forſake his Way, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous Man his Thoughts, if God doth abundantly pardon:</hi> And to forſake it, is more than a bare Refraining from Sin; he muſt give over all Acquaintance with it, and watch continually againſt it. Whoſoever retains <hi>any one</hi> Beloved, Darling Sin, cannot be ſaid to forſake Sin, tho' he refrain from <hi>all others.</hi> He muſt forſake it, ſo as to return to God, and walk in a contrary Path. It muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken as to the Affection and Love of it, as well as the Outward Practice. Then we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Sin indeed, when we loath it, and hate it, and carefully watch againſt it. As a Man is ſaid to forſake his Meat, (not when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get it, or come by it) but when he has no Stomach to it; ſo doth he forſake his Luſts, (not when he hath no Opportunity) but when he hath no Affection; when there is an Habitual Enmity in his Heart againſt it, and a conſtant Care in the Life to avoid it.</p>
            <p>Is there no Sin but you are deſirous to know, and part with? Do you love the Holy Image of God, wherever you diſcern it? and labour after a greater Conformity to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106979:54"/>Life? Is it the daily Burden of your Hearts, that you inwardly ſanctifie God no more, and glorifie him ſo little in the World? Are your Thoughts, Deſires, Opinions, and and Deſigns chang'd? The Bent of your Souls, and the Courſe of your Lives altered? Can you ſay, <hi>My Heart is inclin'd to keep thy Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes always, even to the end?</hi> Pſal. CXIX. 112. <hi>I eſteem all his Commandments concerning all things to be right?</hi> and am deſirous to know the whole Will of God, that I may do it? And if in particular Inſtances by Temptation, you turn out of the Way, and contract Guilt; are you reſtleſs and uneaſie, 'till you return to God? Can you ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I have kept the Way of the Lord, and have not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly departed from him; for all his Judgments were before me, and I did not put away his Statutes from me; I was alſo upright before him, and kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity,</hi> Pſal. XVIII. 21, 22, 23. I confeſs, as to Sins that by <hi>the Temperament and Conſtitution of the Body,</hi> we are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd and tempted to, than to other Sins, a Total Victory is not to be expected, ſo as in no Degrees to fall into ſuch Sins after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Take heed in ſuch Caſes, that you riſe again ſpeedily by Repentance; that you walk ſoftly and humbly; and that the principal Tendency of your Repentance and Prayer be againſt thoſe Sins: And you will gradually get Strength againſt 'em: So as to ſay, that <hi>no Iniquity hath Dominion over you;</hi> that you are
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:106979:54"/>not the willing Servants of Sin, ſo as to love it, and deliberately to allow it; but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of your Soul is to be freed from it, to have Sin ſubdu'd, as well as forgiven?</p>
            <p n="2">III. What can you ſay, as to the Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Loving, and Prizing of Chriſt, by whom we have Forgiveneſs? Have you heartily Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him in all his Offices, as offered in the Goſpel? Aſſenting to his Doctrine, as a Teacher ſent from God, and our great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet? Relying on his Sacrifice and Mediation; as our great High-Prieſt? And ſubjecting to him as Lord and Ruler? This is <hi>Receiving him as Chriſt Jeſus the Lord.</hi> This is an Honour due to him, for the Pardon and Salvation he hath procured for us: And God hath made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our Intereſt in the Beneſits of his Death. Do we aſſent to the Doctrine of Salvation, reveal'd and publiſh'd by Chriſt, and atteſted from Heaven, as certainly true? That Jeſus is the Chriſt of God, and <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth on him ſhall not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life?</hi> Hereupon are we brought to truſt to the Mercy of God in Chriſt, in Hopes of his Salvation, which is freely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unto Sinners in the Goſpel? Do we ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our ſelves entirely to him, as one whom God hath exalted to be a Prince and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins? Reſolving to be ſway'd by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and rul'd by his Direction, and follow
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106979:55"/>him as our Captain and Commander, Guide and Saviour, as long as we live? Endeavouring in Heart and Life, to be well pleaſing in his Sight, that whether we live or dye, we may be <hi>His?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If your Sins are forgiven, 'tis for Chriſt's ſake.</hi> Conſider what Application have you ever made to him, for the cleanſing Virtue of his Blood? Since if you are waſhed, if you are pardoned, it muſt be through the Blood of the Lamb; have you look'd to him, whom you have pierced, and mourn'd, and been in Bitterneſs for him, as one that is in Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his firſt born? <hi>Zac.</hi> XII. 10. Have you lookt upon a Crucify'd Saviour, Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Groaning, Dying for Sin, to reconcile us to God, and turn us from our Iniquities? Have you been anſwerably affected with the Sufferings of Chriſt, and improv'd thereby in your Hatred of Sin?</p>
            <p n="2">IV. <hi>What Thankfulneſs to God, and what Love to Jeſus Chriſt the Redeemer, doth the Hope of Forgiveneſs excite in you?</hi> You read how the Penitent in the Goſpel <hi>Loved much, becauſe much was forgiven,</hi> Luke VII. 47. How did St. <hi>Peter</hi> appeal to Chriſt after the Forgiveneſs of his Sin; <hi>Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> Your Love to Chriſt, and every thing that relates to him, will be a good Argument of the Forgiveneſs of Sin: For having Peace with God, the Love of Chriſt is ſhed abroad in our Hearts. How
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106979:55"/>have your Hearts been affected with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God, for the Riches of his Grace in this Forgiveneſs? For the Purchaſe of it, for the Offer of it; and for any good Hope of your ſpecial Intereſt in it? What admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Thoughts have you of the Height and Depth, Length and Breadth of the Love of God in Chriſt to loſt Sinners? With what Thoughts do you Conſider the Curſe of the Law, the Terrors of Death, the Power of Satan, and the Wrath of God? (From all which you are deliver'd by Chriſt.) With what Affection do you Contemplate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Glorious Priviledges, Benefits and Bleſſings, that accompany this Forgiveneſs? With what Admiring Love to the Redeemer, do you from time to time review his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion and Humiliation? How low he ſtoopt, and how readily? How great things he ſuffered, and how willingly? Even to drink the Dregs of that bitter Cup, (which but to taſte of) would have made Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſtagger into Hell. With what Frame of Spirit, can you conſider Chriſt offer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs for you, making his Soul a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for you? When you Conſider with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Application to your ſelves, <hi>He gave himſelf for me, ſhed his precious Blood for me.</hi> 
               <q>O my Soul, 'twas that I might eſcape Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; that I might be reconcil'd to God, that my Crimſon and Scarlet Sins might be pardoned; that my Guilty, Polluted,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106979:56"/>Miſerable Soul, might be reſtor'd to the Image of God, and Communion with him.</q> What Affections, what Joy have you from ſuch Thoughts? Eſpecially at the Lord's-Table, when you conſider his Body broken for you, his Blood ſhed for the Remiſſion of your Sins, wounded for your Tranſgreſſions, bruiſed for your Iniquities, that by his Stripes you might be healed?</p>
            <p n="5">V. Moreover, <hi>How are you affected with the Sins, that you hope God hath pardon'd?</hi> Do your Souls melt with a Godly Sorrow for thoſe Crimes, that you hope are forgiven? What penitent Mourning doth the Pſalmiſt expreſs in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. which was penn'd after God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd him, that his Adultery and Murder ſhould be forgiven; and after the Prophet had told him, <hi>The Lord hath put away thy Sin; O Lord have Mercy upon me, and waſh me, and cleanſe me, and blot out my Tranſgreſſion: Againſt thee, thee only have I ſinned, and done this Evil in thy Sight,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What Influence hath God's free Mercy in pardoning Sin, upon you, as to Shame and Sorrow for it? Doth the Thoughts, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all thy Provocations God will be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, humble and ſhame thee the more? To this purpoſe, you know the Holy Spirit is promiſed in the Times of the Goſpel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> XVI. 63. <hi>That thou may'ſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy Mouth any more,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106979:56"/>becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacify'd toward thee, for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Is this the Language of your Hearts? <q>He might have condemn'd me to Hell long agoe, but through the Precious Blood of Jeſus, I have Hopes of Forgiveneſs. O what an Ungrateful Wretch have I been! What Love have I deſpiſed! Againſt whom have I ſinned! How have I rebell'd againſt the God of Love and Grace, and griev'd his good Spirit! Againſt what Bowels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy have I ſpurn'd? I am aſtoniſhed at the Mercy of God in Chriſt, offer'd to ſuch a Rebel as I am: I am confounded at my own Vileneſs, that ſuch Hainous Iniquities ſhould be blotted out, that ſuch numberleſs Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities ſhould be forgiven; that after I had ſo often, and ſo long, and ſo wilfully turn'd my Back upon him, he ſhould yet call after me, and ſay, <hi>I am he, behold I am he, that bletteth out thy Tranſgreſſion for my own Name ſake, and will remember thy ſins no more.</hi> That when God ſaw me, and might have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me; might have made me an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Juſtice here, or might have ſent me quick to Hell; or might have left me unto Hardneſs of Heart, to treaſure up Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath; that he ſhould freely forgive me all, and be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly reconcil'd to me, and ſpeak Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Peace to my Soul. O Wretch that I have been!</q> O Abominable Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner!
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106979:57"/>I abhor my ſelf in Duſt and Aſhes.</p>
            <p>We find this Exemplify'd in the Temper and Spirit of thoſe, to whom the Mercy and Grace of God is diſcovered, eſpecially in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> He aggravates his Sin, and owns himſelf the <hi>Chiefeſt of Sinners;</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more ſo, than when he is thinking, and ſpeaking of Chriſt's Coming into the World to ſave Sinners; and how wonderfully he called him, and ſhow'd Mercy to him. Read this at large, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> I. 14, 15, 16, 17. And the ſight of God's Mercy, and Senſe of his Pardon, is in it ſelf proper to raiſe an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of Free Grace; and to humble the Soul before God. It is proper to encreaſe our Deteſtation of Sin, and make us loath our ſelves. That which raiſeth our Love to God, muſt needs raiſe our Hatred of Sin, and Sorrow for it. Now <hi>Faith</hi> will make us Love much, in the Sence of having much For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Inſeperable Connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> will evidence this. We ſhall never adore the Love of Chriſt, as a Redeemer delivering us from the Curſe; if we are not burden'd with the Weight of our Sins: Nor ſhall we ever give God the Glory of his Juſtice, without judging and condemning our ſelves by true Repentance. Yet the more we ſee, and apprehend of his Grace, and Love in Forgiveneſs, the more broken and contrite, the more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106979:57"/>and aſhamed ſhall we be, of our Sins againſt him.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Laſtly, <hi>What can you ſay as to the Love of your Enemies, and forgiving thoſe who have injured and wronged you?</hi> There is no better Evidence of God's forgiveneſs of your Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, than that he hath given you an Heart to forgive Others, who have treſpaſſed againſt you: If it be upon a right Principle, becauſe God for Chriſt's ſake hath pardon'd you, and obliged you to forgive Others. <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> Was there ever ſuch a Diſtance between my Brother and me, as my Sins have made between God and me? Were the Injuries I reſented from Others, comparable to the Affronts I have offer'd to God? and hath he freely for Chriſt's ſake forgiven me?</q> What Influence hath ſuch a Thought, to cure and overcome the Ruggedneſs, and Rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Temper and Spirit towards Others? If God hath pardon'd thee, go and do likewiſe as to thy Brother. <hi>For if you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not Men their Treſpaſſes, your Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath not, and will not forgive you yours,</hi> Mat. VI. 14. If you have a Rancorous, Bitter, Malicious, Revengeful Spirit; and will not forgive thoſe that have wronged you; how can you expect Forgiveneſs from God? Do you then forgive thoſe that have injured you, as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you? <hi>Heartily,</hi> and without Diſſembling; <hi>Speedily,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:106979:58"/>and without Delay; <hi>Frequently</hi> and Often, without Limitation; <hi>Even unto ſeventy times ſeven, if our Brother offend;</hi> that is, ſo often as he doth? And this <hi>Throughly,</hi> and without Reſerve; without Exception, or Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; without Remembring paſt Offences, ſo as to bear them a Grudge? This, I grant, is hard and difficult Work; but the Spirit of Chriſt can enable us to do this. 'Tis the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Duty of ſuch as are forgiven, and it is a <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> that they are ſo. Hath God forgiven me my Scarlet and Crimſon Sins? and ſhall not I put up an Injury, bear a Wrong, endure a Reproach, or an ill Turn, from my Fellow Creature? Shall I not in Obedience to Chriſt, forgive him, and paſs it by?</p>
            <p>By theſe things, if Conſcience be faithful, you may be aſſiſted to make a Judgment of your ſelves, whether you are intereſted in this Forgiveneſs or no. And if your Sins have been many and great, whether you may, on good Grounds hope, and ſay, that God hath <hi>Abundantly Pardon'd.</hi>

            <p n="2">III. I Proceed to the Third General in this Paſſage, <hi>viz.</hi> The annex'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Verſe</hi> the 9th. why we ought to be fully ſatisfy'd and perſwaded, that God will thus receive Returning Sinners, and abundantly pardon them; becauſe <hi>His Thoughts are not as ours, nor his Ways as ours,</hi> &amp;c. And here you may Conſider,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How this is Diſcover'd and Expreſs'd, by a Double Compariſon of <hi>God's Thoughts</hi> with ours, and <hi>his Ways</hi> with ours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How 'tis ſtrongly argu'd by a moſt ſignificant Similitude; <hi>As far as the Heavens are above the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The expreſs Aſſurance of the Truth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106979:59"/>of all this, from the Divine Teſtimony that is added, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi> That no Doubt may be made about it. The whole of this, may be compriz'd in theſe Three Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>the Thoughts of God,</hi> eſpecially in the Diſpenſation of his Grace and Mercy to Returning Sinners, are <hi>very different</hi> from our Thoughts; and Tranſcendently <hi>above them,</hi> as far as the Heavens are above the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>the Ways of God</hi> are unlike our Ways, and Tranſcendently above them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That <hi>God's Teſtimony</hi> concerning his Thoughts, and Ways of Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to Sinners, ought to be credited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, and is a ſufficient Ground of Faith: <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord</hi> being added.</p>
            <p>'Tis the firſt I principally deſign, that the Thoughts of God are not as ours, but very unlike them, and Tranſcendently above them; as far as the Heavens are above the Earth. This I ſhall Endeavour to Prove, Confirm, and Apply. And here are two Things will need a little Explication.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> How the Thoughts of God are <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> from ours, not like them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> How they are Tranſcendently <hi>above them,</hi> as far as the Heavens are above the Earth. The Firſt I ſhall conſider more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally. The Second with more Particular Relation to God's pardoning Mercy.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:106979:59"/> I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They are Different and Unlike. <hi>My Thoughts are not as your Thoughts.</hi> There's an Expreſſion to this purpoſe in the Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> to ſet out this Difference in General, <hi>Prov.</hi> XIX. 21. <hi>There are many Devices in the Heart of Man, but the Counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand.</hi> What is ſaid by the Prophet of God's Thoughts, is affirmed by the Wiſe Man of God's Purpoſes; that they are not as ours. Ours are vain and uncertain, his are certain, fixt, and ſtable. He makes a Threefold Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Name, Ours are but <hi>Devices;</hi> God's are <hi>Counſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He expreſſes them in a different Number, ours are in the Plural Number, with an Expreſſion of Multiplicity, there are <hi>many Devices</hi> in the Heart of Man, but God's Purpoſes are <hi>One Regular, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niform Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A different manner of Exiſting is implyed; our Purpoſes are conceiv'd in the Heart, we can't bring them forth, nor give them a Being out of our own Minds: We may contrive and plot, deſign and reſolve, but ſtill the Devices are <hi>in our own Hearts:</hi> 'Tis not in our Power to accompliſh and bring them to paſs, to make them firm and faſt againſt Oppoſition. But the Counſel of the Lord, and every part of it, <hi>ſhall ſtand.</hi> So great is the Difference between God's Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and ours, God's Thoughts and Ours. But that which the Text refers to, is the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106979:60"/>Diſpenſation of God's Grace and Mercy to Returning Sinners. We muſt not meaſure God's Thoughts and Purpoſes by our own. The Holy Scriptures repreſent them to be beyond our Fathom; ſuch as cannot enter into our Hearts to conceive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 9.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall ſhow the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>between God's Thoughts and Ours, as to two remarkable Inſtances among others. (1.) As to other Mens Sins and Offences againſt us, and ours againſt God. (2.) As to our Afflictions and Sufferings from the Hand of God. In both reſpects, our Thoughts are very <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlike</hi> God's, very <hi>Different</hi> from his.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> We muſt not judge of God's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy to us, by our Thoughts and Carriage towards Others, who have offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are eaſily, ſuddenly, quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd and provok'd to Anger. Upon every little Affront and Injury, Thoughts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge are apt to riſe in our Hearts. We can bear very little with one another. We muſt have other Thoughts of the Patience, Forbearance, and Long-ſuffering of God. When the Diſciples would have called for Fire from Heaven upon the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> Luke IX. 54. Our Lord told them, <hi>Ye know not what Spirit ye are of.</hi> 'Tis not a Divine Spirit, 'tis not the Spirit of God; that appears be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106979:60"/>ſo eaſily, and preſently provok'd. Tho' God be offended and affronted by the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked every day, and hath always Power to execute his Vengeance; yet he bears, with much Long-ſuffering and Patience, even the Veſſels of Wrath fitted for Deſtruction. His Thoughts are not as ours in this Reſpect: He hath reveal'd himſelf to be <hi>ſlow to Anger,</hi> and of great Long-ſuffering and Patience: Let us not Conclude, that he cannot, will not, bear with us; becauſe we cannot bear with one another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When we are injur'd and offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Others, we are not eaſily reconcil'd; not ready to forgive, don't ſeek after Peace. Whereas the Bleſſed God, whom we deſpiſe, and provoke by multiply'd Crimes, he waits to be Gracious, and invites us to Return; beſeecheth us to be reconcil'd: He freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to forgive us, and aſſures us he will abundantly pardon. 'Tis true, the Divine Spirit, ſo far as it obtains, and is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to any, makes them eaſie to be entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, forward to forgive, willing to be at peace with thoſe that have injur'd 'em, and not to return Evil, or refuſe Terms of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But ordinarily it is manifeſt, that our Temper, and Carriage to other Men, is quite Different. And we ſhould have very wrong Thoughts of God, if we apprehend him to be as unwilling to forgive us, as we often are to pardon thoſe that have offended us. Let
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106979:61"/>us think of it with ſhame, as to thoſe that may have treſpaſs'd againſt us. What though they did begin the Quarrel, and gave us juſt Occaſion of Anger; what though they have been unthankful, and we have obliged them; and deſerv'd to be otherwiſe treated; Shall we yet retain Anger, let the Sun go down on our Wrath, and diſcover an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Spirit? How Different is this from the Divine Spirit? and how unlike are our Thoughts to God's Thoughts? You are not to think of God in this Particular, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what you find in your ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Our Thoughts towards Others, who have injur'd us, are ſtraitned and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Poſſibly we may pardon once or twice, paſs by two or three Offences; but if the ſame Perſon treſpaſs again and again ſeveral times, we think he hath no Right to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, nor are we oblig'd to pardon him; even tho' he ſhould repent. But our Lord hath told us otherwiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> XVIII. 21. that if we will be like our Heavenly Father, we muſt not only forgive <hi>ſeven times,</hi> but <hi>ſeventy times ſeven.</hi> We have but a little Pity, our Bowels are ſtraitned, we can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don but a few Offences; but God doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon, and ſhow Mercy to a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Generations, and forgive Ten thouſand Sins. He hath <hi>a multitude of Mercies,</hi> Pſal. V. 7. <hi>A multitude of Loving Kindneſſes,</hi> Iſa. LXIII. 7. He is <hi>Rich in Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Abundant
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:106979:61"/>in Goodneſs.</hi> He can, and doth forgive, not only Sins before Repentance, but Backſlidings afterward. His Compaſſions do not fail, his Mercy endureth for ever; therefore we are not conſum'd. You muſt not meaſure God by your ſelves, nor his Thoughts by your Thoughts, in this Particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If we forgive thoſe that Injure us, we are backward to do them Good, to treat them with Kindneſs, and ſhew them Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. It may be, we won't revenge our ſelves; we'll do them no Harm: But we avoid them, are ſhy toward them, we will not be kind to them: But God's Thoughts are not as ours in this Reſpect. He follows us Rebels, with continued Tokens of his Favour, loads us with his Benefits every day of our Lives; tho' we load him with our Sins. He heaps Coals of Fire upon our Heads; takes care of us, ſupports, ſupplies, provides for us; and is conſtantly kind to us, even while we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front him. And after he has forgiven us, he takes us to be his Friends, and Favourites, and Children: All the Mercies of thy paſt Life, all thy preſent Enjoyments are from him, againſt whom thou haſt ſinned. Thou haſt depended on his Providence ever ſince thou hadſt a Being, for daily Breath, and daily Bread. He ſaves thee from a thouſand Deaths and Dangers; thy Eſtate, thy Health, thy Credit, thy Liberty, thy Uſefulneſs, thy Comfort in Relations, and whatever good
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106979:62"/>thou haſt, he gave thee: And he hath offer'd to give thee his Son, his Spirit, his Grace, his Glory, Himſelf to be thy All-ſufficient Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and God in Covenant: And all this, while thou haſt been in Rebellion againſt him; a Wretched Criminal againſt the Lord of thy Life, and the God of thy Mercies. O how unlike are God's Thoughts to ours in this Reſpect! Conſidering what our Thoughts are, to thoſe who have injur'd and offended us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider your ſelves under Affliction and Suffering from the Hand of God; and how different God's Thoughts and yours are in that Reſpect alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We preſently conclude, that 'tis all from Anger and Wrath, whereas God ſays, <hi>Whom he loves he chaſtens;</hi> and that 'tis for our good, and that we are dealt with as Sons, and not as Baſtards, <hi>Heb.</hi> XII. 5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> CXIX. 75.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are pettiſh and froward, peeviſh and perverſe under the Rod of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, while God's Thoughts are Thoughts of Peace toward us. When <hi>For the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Covetouſneſs I was wroth,</hi> (becauſe he had no Heart to do good with what I lent him, ſaith God concerning <hi>Ephraim</hi>) <hi>and I ſote him, he went on frowardly in the way of his own Heart: Nevertheleſs I have ſeen his ways, I will heal him, I will lead him, and reſtore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:106979:62"/>Comfort to him,</hi> Iſa. LVII. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We often under Affliction take every hiding of God's Face, for an utter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of us, whereas God hath no ſuch Thoughts. He hath us ſtill in his Eye, and bears us on his Heart, hath our Names graven on the Palmes of his Hand, loves us ſtill, tho' he rebuke us; and will convince us of it by ſeaſonable Comforts and Deliverance, <hi>Jer.</hi> XXXI. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? I have heard him bemoaning himſelf,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the Yoke; turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God.</hi> Is he my dear Son, or rather is he not ſo? is he a pleaſant Child, is he not ſo ſtill to me? <hi>For ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do remember him ſtill; therefore my Bowels are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him, I will ſurely have Mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God's Thoughts are not as ours in reſpect of Affliciton, as t othe Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Rod. We are often ready to ſink, and be diſpirited and overwhelm'd in a Time of Darkneſs, as if it would never be Light: We are ready to give up all for loſt, and conclude that God is gone for ever, and will be Merciful no more: Saying, <hi>Our Bones are dryed up, our Hope is loſt, we are cut off for our parts,</hi> Ezek. XXXVII. 11. Whereas God's thoughts are otherwiſe, he'll make thoſe dry Bones live, and fetch them out of the Grave
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106979:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Affliction. <hi>His Thoughts are Thoughts of Peace, to give us a Deſired End,</hi> Jer. XXIX. 11. How many have thought and ſaid in their Deſpair, that God's Mercy was gone for ever; concerning whom he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, that his Thoughts are not as theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God's Thoughts are not as ours, as to the End and Deſign, which he aims at in our Affliction. We think he intends not to refine, but ruine; not to purifie, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. Whereas in Faithfulneſs he afflicts, where he knows we need it; to purge away our Droſs, and take away our Tin; and to produce the Peaceable Fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: <hi>By this ſhall the Iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this ſhall be the fruit of all, to take away ſin,</hi> Iſa. XXVII. 9. Do but wait a little, and you'l ſee, how you have been miſtaken in your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of God; and how his Thoughts have been unlike to yours.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let us conſider in the Second Place, that God's Thoughts are not only different from ours, but <hi>Tranſcendently above them;</hi> as far, and as high as the Heavens are above the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> as to the <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> His THoughts of Grace and Kindneſs are of <hi>an unſearchable Depth. O the Depth of the Riches of the Wiſdom and the Knowledge of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106979:63"/>God! whoſe Ways</hi> (of Mercy as well as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>are unſearchable, and paſt our finding out,</hi> Rom. XI. 33. There is a Depth in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Line of Men and Angels to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> XCII. 5. <hi>O Lord, how great are thy Works! and thy Thoughts are very deep.</hi> In the Revelation of God's Grace and Mercy to Sinners by the Goſpel, we read of the <hi>deep thigns of God,</hi> ſuch as Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it entred int othe Heart of Man to conceive; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XI. 1-. Such Depths that amaze the very Angels to look into, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> I. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God's Thoughts of Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are <hi>Abſolute, Soveraign,</hi> and <hi>Independent.</hi> 'Tis all after the Counſel of his own Will, and from the meer Good Pleaſure of his Will. This is the Source and Spring of all his Mercy and Forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God's Thoughts of Mercy are <hi>Faithful and Effectual.</hi> ALl the Declarations of his Mercy ſhall be made good; All the Promives of Grace ſhall be fulfilled; All the Thoughts of his Love ſhall have their Effects. <hi>O Lord, I will exalt thee, for thy Counſels of Old are Faithfulneſs and Truth,</hi> Iſa. XXV. 1. All his Ways are Mercy and Truth, he keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Covenant and Mercy for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> LXXXIX. 28, 29. Tho' he viſit their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Rod, yet his Loving Kindneſs will he not take from them, nor ſuffer his Faithfulneſs to fail. Therfore,</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:106979:64"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may be added, that God's Thoughts are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable,</hi> but ours are Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable: The Strength of <hi>Iſrael</hi> will not lye or repent. <hi>He is not a Man, that he ſhould lye, nor the Son of Man, that he ſhould repent,</hi> 1 Sam. XV. 29. The Medicator of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant lives for ever, to make Interceſſion for Sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> His Thoughts of Mercy are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>Pure,</hi> and infinitely <hi>Righteous.</hi> We ſhall never fully underſtand the infinite Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's Thoughts and Ways, 'till the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God. He is Righteous in all his Counſels, and in all his Works; all his Ways are equal. <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee.</hi> The Pſalmiſt tells us, that God will carry on his Thoughts of Mercy, and perfect his Grace, and make it thrive and grow: <hi>To ſhow that he is upright, and there's no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in him,</hi> Pſal. XCII. <hi>laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> God's Thoughts of Grace and Mercy are tranſcendently above ours, <hi>in the Way and Manner of his diſpenſing his Grace and Mercy.</hi> The Diſpenſation of his Love and Grace to Sinners, is that which paſſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to the Manner of it: And when this Love is ſhed abroad in the Heart, there is a Peace reſulting from it, which is better felt than expreſt. Something may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and ſpoken, but there's a great deal, which is above the reach of Words, for we
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106979:64"/>have no Line to meaſure it by, no Scale in all the World to weigh it in: We have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to compare it unto, but falls unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhort. No Kindneſs, no Love, no Charity or Affection of one Creature to another, by which we can ſet it forth. The neareſt and deareſt among Men, is as much below this, as Earth is below Heaven. The Riches of his Grace in Chriſt to Sinners, 'tis call'd <hi>the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt.</hi> HOw admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable are the Dimenſions of Divine Grace and Love, mention'd by the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> III. 19. where he ſpeaks of the <hi>Length, Breadeth, Heigth</hi> and <hi>Depth of the Love of God in Chriſt,</hi> which paſſeth Knowledge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's <hi>Breadth,</hi> reaching unto <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> Circumciſion and Uncircumciſion, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, Scythian,</hi> Bond and Free, Poor and Rich. The Vileſt and Chiefeſt of Sinners are not exempted: Mercy is extended to all ſorts of Perſons and Caſes. 'Tis Grace and Love, wider than all our Neceſſities and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, Sins and Wants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Length</hi> of it, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting; reaching to Sinners that were at the greateſt Diſtance; bringing thoſe nigh that are afar off, and calling thoſe home who are wandering and gone off; ſo as one might have thought, they ſhould never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Depth</hi> of that Love and Grace is unſearchable. Unleſs we underſtood the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106979:65"/>Depth of that Miſery and Ruine, into which we were ſunk by our Rebellion againſt God, and are deliver'd from, by his pardoning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; unleſs we underſtood the Horror of that Hell of Wrath, which our Sins deſerve; and the Extremity of thoſe Agonies and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which our Bleſſed Redeemer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, for our Deliverance; unleſs we knew the Power of God's Wrath, and the Intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, Endleſs Miſery of loſt Souls, we cannot fully underſtand the Depth of this Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Height</hi> of it is alſo unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. 'Tis as high as Heaven, to which it will bring us: And beyond our reach to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, unleſs we knew the infinite Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Heavenly Glory, which it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now enter into our Hearts to conceive; as well as the Infinite Miſery of Condemned Sinners in the Bottomleſs Pit. We can no more tell the Height, than the Depth, of this Grace of God in thus pardoning Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <p>But to help you a little to ſome more diſtinct Conſiderations of this, let me name a few Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That none doth or can ſo <hi>freely</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgive, as God doth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> None ſo <hi>continually. Thirdly,</hi> So <hi>fully. FOurthly,</hi> So <hi>indifferently,</hi> and <hi>without reſpect of Perſons. Fifthly,</hi> None ſo <hi>tenderly</hi> and <hi>affectionately,</hi> and with ſuch Bowels of Compaſſion, and Tender Kindneſs, as God doth.</p>
            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:106979:65"/>
            <p> Firſt, <hi>None ſo freely:</hi> If we are brought to forgive thoſe that have wrong'd us, 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly on the Entreaty and Interceſſion of ſome Friends, who have Intereſt in us, and Power over us; and this after great Submiſſions of the Offender. So that 'tis rather from ſome External Motives and Inducements, than from our own Kind and Generous Inclinations: But 'tis otherwiſe when we are pardon'd by God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> XLIII. 23. <hi>I am he that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſions, for my own ſake, I'le not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy Sins any more,</hi> Hoſ. XIV. 4. I will heal their Backſlidings, <hi>and love them freely.</hi> Nothing of our Prayers and Tears, Submiſſions and Humiliations, nothing we can do or ſuffer, can make the leaſt Compenſation to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, for the Contempt and Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we have caſt on him by Sin. There's nothing but the Free-Grace of God in Chriſt, to be ey'd, to be pleaded, to be truſted to, and depended upon. In this Caſe, there is no Difference between ſuch as are forgiven, and ſuch as are left under Damning Guilt, but what is made by the Free-Grace of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>None ſo continually.</hi> He encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and commands us to beg daily Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as daily Bread: He renews his pardoning Mercy every Day, and every Hour. We ſoon come to the End of our Pity, and are quickly tyr'd in forgiving Injuries againſt our ſelves. But while we live, we ſhall ſtand in need of Forgiveneſs from God. And this is
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106979:66"/>our Comfort, that if we ſin, we have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, who maketh continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Interceſſion for us; and ſo we hope for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual, daily, renewed Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> None doth or can pardon ſo <hi>compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>fully.</hi> He blotteth out our Tranſgreſſions, ſo as to remember them no more; he caſts them behind his Back, throws them into the Depths of the Sea. Many other Bleſſings he beſtows, and lends us for a time, and then calls for them again; but this Forgiveneſs of Sin, is one of thoſe Mercies that are Irrevocable, and without Repentance. We may be without the Knowledge of an Intereſt in his pardoning Mercy, we may loſe the Senſe of it, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the Comfort of it; but if we are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, united to Chriſt, and brought under the Bond of the Everlaſting Covenant; tho' he may chaſten us as a Father, and viſit our Iniquities with Stripes, he will not diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit us, or caſt us out of his Family: His Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant Favour and Kindneſs ſhall never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, his Covenant of Peace ſhall never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> LIV. 9. This is as the Waters of <hi>Noah,</hi> which ſhall never return to overflow the Earth. Fatherly Love may be angry, but will not turn to Hatred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> None doth or can pardon ſo <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently, without reſpect of Perſons.</hi> Not only leſſer Sinners who repent, but the Vileſt; not only of ſuch a Nation, but of any Nation; not only ſuch as have ſinned thus long, unto
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106979:66"/>ſuch a Degree; but if beyond all ordinary Bounds and Meaſures. Let the Wickedneſs, and Unrighteouſneſs, Vileneſs, and Filthineſs, and Aggravations of Sin be what they will, If you return to God by Chriſt, he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon. This ſhould magnifie the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his Grace to ſome of you, who are intereſted in this Forgiveneſs. <q>
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> How is it that my Sins are pardon'd, when others (not greater Sinners than I) have dyed in their Sins, and are undone for ever! How is it that I am pardon'd, and others that have not been ſo Vile, ſhall never be forgiven! How is it that I have been forgiven, and Others that were my Companions in Sin, were left to Impenitence and Hardneſs of Heart! That many of better Parts, of more Wit, of more Learning, of larger Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, and bettter accompliſhd'd for Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Service, are left to go on in Sin, to their own Deſtruction; and thy Grace has open'd my Eyes, and ſoften'd my Heart, and made me ſenſible of Sin, and ſo to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue a Redeemer, to ſeek him, receive him, accept him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> None <hi>with ſuch Tenderneſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</hi> All the Bowels of Parents are Stone and Adamant, in compariſon with his. We read of his Delighting in Mercy, and of his Tender Mercies, and Loving Kindneſſes; of his <hi>Rejoycing over us to do us good, with his whole Heart, and whole Soul,</hi> Jer. XXXII. 41. Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106979:67"/>and Love is his very Nature, for <hi>God is Love.</hi> He pities us more, than any, the moſt Tender Parent, ever did a Miſerable Child. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion and Sin; and paſſeth by the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Remnant, becauſe he delighteth in Mercy?</hi> Micah VII. 19.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Application</hi> I ſhall make of this ſhall be, to endeavour to bring it home to the Caſe of particular Perſons, in Anſwer to ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. For Inſtance,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Some may be ready to ſay not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, <q>I have ſuch a ſight of my own paſt Crimes, and their Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, that none can judge of my Caſe as I can, or know the worſt of it as I do. I knew the Will of God, and yet diſobey'd him: I have ſinn'd, when I knew God did forbid it, and threaten'd with Eternal Death what I was doing: I have hearkned to Temptation, tho' I had vow'd, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd, and reſolv'd, and engag'd againſt that very Sin I was tempted to. And which was worſe, I had ſome Thoughts of God's ſeeing me, ſome Apprehenſions that he would judge me for it; and yet I went on and ſinned: Surely God will never forgive me. If any of my Fellow Creatures had wilfully, deliberately, ungratefully, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perfidiouſly, deſpiſed and affronted, injured and offended me; I that am but a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106979:67"/>Worm, could have no Patience with ſuch a One: Much more may the Bleſſed God reſent, remember, and puniſh ſuch Vile Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities as I have been guilty of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſider in Anſwer to this, how high the Heavens are above the Earth, and (which is more) the difference between the Creature and the Creator: That his Thoughts are not as ours; not like our miſgiving, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing Thoughts. He doth and will pardon <hi>like himſelf,</hi> like <hi>a God:</hi> Not after the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a finite, paſſionate, weak Man. All that you have ſaid, or can ſay, ſhall be no Impediment, if you return to God, and ſeek him in Chriſt for Forgiveneſs. He will <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon,</hi> beyond what you are able to think, or ſuppoſe in the like Caſe. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as prone and enclin'd to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide, yet he cannot find in his Heart to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy 'em, but expreſſes a kind of Conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Juſtice and Mercy; and at laſt reſolves, <hi>I am God, and not Man,</hi> therfore I will not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Fierceneſs of mine Anger, <hi>but I will cauſe 'em to walk after the Lord,</hi> Hoſea XI. 7, 10.</p>
            <p>He doth all things <hi>like himſelf,</hi> (as one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves). If he build, he makes a World: If he be angry with the World, he ſends a Flood over the Face of all the Earth. If he goes out with the Armies of his People, he makes the Sun ſtand ſtill, the Stars to fight, the Seas to ſwallow up the moſt dreadful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madoes.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106979:68"/>If he love, the precious Hearts Blood of his Beloved Son is not too dear: If any become his Friend and Favourite thro' the Mediation of Chriſt, he will make him a King, give him a Paradiſe, and ſet a Crown of Eternal Glory on his Head. Let us not conſider ſo much what is fit or likely for us to receive, as for ſo Great a God to give and beſtow. If we are contrite, humble, peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and fly to Jeſus Chriſt as our Refuge of Hope: He will think all the meritorious Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his Son, all the Promiſes in his Book, all the Comforts of his Holy Spirit, all the Pleaſures and Bleſſedneſs of his Kingdom, little enough for us.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But ſome will ſay further, <q>I did once hope, that God had given me true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and unfeigned Faith; and that I was hearty and ſincere in my Covenant with God: I had ſome good Hopes, that I was reconcil'd, and that I was accepted: And I ſeal'd my Covenant, and ſet my Name to it, and renew'd it alſo at the Lord's Table. And I thank God, I had ſome Quickning and Comfort, as I thought, but Wretch as I am, I have revolted ſince. I have burſt thoſe Bonds aſunder, I have gone back with ſuch abominable Backſlidings, that I can't think God will ever pardon me; who after I have known the Way of Righteouſneſs, have turn'd from the Holy Commandment. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106979:68"/>having been waſh'd, I have return'd with the Dog to his Vomit, and the Swine to her wallowing in the Mire. I fear I am among thoſe who draw back to Perdition, of whom God may ſay, that his Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Conſider that God's Thoughts are not as yours, as to Returning Backſliders. He calls you to return; <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt fallen by thine Iniquity, return unto the Lord thy God.</hi> He tells you, his Grace and Mercy can outdo all that you can think. If you never heard of any, that have ſinn'd as you have, or with ſuch ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated Backſlidings; he may yet forgive thee. <hi>Though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow, tho' red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool,</hi> Iſa. I. 18. If he give you Grace to repent and return, he will forgive. Sins after Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Sins after unworthy receiving the Lord's Supper, may be pardon'd. There is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain open'd, there is a Ranſom found, there is a Propitiation made, there's an Advocate with the Father. You muſt forgive an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brother if he repent, even unto ſeventy times ſeven. And will not God forgive Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Backſliders, and multiply Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? This Text is the moſt proper Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that can be, for ſuch to conſider; that they may not think, that no Mercy ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them. They are invited to return, with a Promiſe that <hi>God will heal their Backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,</hi> Hoſ. XIV. 3, 4. Jer. III. <hi>beginning.;</hi> and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106979:69"/>afterward, <hi>Verſe</hi> the 21ſt. <hi>Go and proclaim theſe Words, ſaying, return ye backſliding Iſrael, (ſaith the Lord) and I will not cauſe my Anger to fall upon you; for I am merciful, (ſaith the Lord) and will not keep Anger for ever.</hi> You ought therfore, to add the following Words; <hi>Behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God.</hi> Return to him with all your Hearts, he will receive you graciouſly, and love you freely. <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal</hi> is entertain'd upon his Return, more than the Firſt-born, aſſoon as he repents, and ſaith, <hi>I am unworthy to be called thy Son.</hi> He will heal your Backſlidings, and <hi>take away all Iniquity;</hi> the Guilt, the Stain, the Power, the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Anguiſh of Conſcience. He will not impute thy Sin, he will purge thy Conſcience from dead works, and enable thee to ſerve and obey him. The Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall ariſe on thee with healing in his Wings; the Influence of his Holy Spirit ſhall by Grace and Comfort be reſtored to thee. And all this from his Free Love and Mercy. Nothing is too hard for Love, Divine Love.</p>
            <p>It is, I confeſs, a real Difficulty, when one is made ſenſible of great Sins after <hi>Repentance,</hi> and I know of no Relief like that, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from this Scripture.

Why <hi>his Infinite Love, Condeſcenſion and Grace.</hi> Well, but I have revolted and gone
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106979:69"/>back, by many aggravated Back-ſlidings, that ſtare me in the Face: Yet <hi>God is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeable,</hi> he's not only Merciful but <hi>Faithful to his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> And his Faithfulneſs was never enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the Angels that fell. But here's the great Objection, that will be made to all this. This is true, but <hi>I am unfaithful,</hi> and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs of one Party, in all Covenants, diſobliges the other Party. In Anſwer to this, I ſay, <hi>He's God, and not Man.</hi> His Thoughts are not as ours. Among Men, in all Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants this is true, but God's Thoughts and Ways are <hi>above ours.</hi> Therfore if I yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and take hold of his Covenant; I may argue I am within the Bond of it, and he will not utterly caſt me off, but forgive me upon Repentance. I have read of one in Deſpair, whom the Devil perſwaded it was in vain to pray to God, or ſerve him, for he muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; he ſhould be damned, and go to Hell when he dy'd; who yet went to Prayer, and begg'd of God, that if he muſt go to Hell when he dyed, yet that it would pleaſe him, to let him ſerve him while he liv'd: Upon which his Terrors vaniſh'd, being clearly convinc'd, none could pray that Prayer, or make ſuch a Requeſt, who was guilty of the Unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Sin, or had ſinn'd <hi>the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106979:70"/>a time; and I thought I was in Favour with God, and had an Intereſt in this Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis. But I have often heard it, (and I believe it) that God never pardons Sin, where he doth not <hi>ſubdue</hi> it. Juſtification and Sanctification go together: If the Guilt of Sin be forgiven, the Power of it is broken. But I find Corruption is ſtrong, evil Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are ſtill ſtirring and raging. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver imagin'd, there was ſuch a Hell of Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs in my Heart, as I now find.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God's Thoughts and yours are very different in this Matter. For he attains Wiſe and Holy Ends, by ſuffering us to feel Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and obliging us to continual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with it; by ſanctifying us gradually, and not all at once; by letting us ſee and feel more of Corruption ſtirring, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, after Converſion, than ever we knew before. Hereby he ingages us in conſtant Warfare all our days; and makes it needful, that we may apply to Chriſt continually, as the great Phyſitian of Souls. And I beſeech you, remember and believe this, That <hi>No Sin, no Corruption that is your Burden, that you would rather be rid of than keep, ſhall ever be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I am dead in all my Duties, I can't pray. I have no ſuch Liberty, and Freedom, and Livelineſs in Prayer, as others have. I come to the Lord's-Table, but I have no ſuch Sealing, no ſuch Comfort, no ſuch Aſſurance, no ſuch Joy, no ſuch Foretaſts of Heaven, as I believe others have. I keep on in a round of Duty, but 'tis not with me, as with the Living Members of Chriſt. Therfore I can't apply all this to my ſelf with Comfort.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God's Thoughts are not as yours in this Matter. You object, that you can't pray with ſuch Life and Enlargement as others, and as formerly: But is it not your Burden? Are you not diſſatisfied with your ſelves about it? Do you not beg the Spirit of Prayer, and to have this ill Frame cur'd? Do you not look up to Heaven with daily Sighs and Groans? and beg Relief from Chriſt, as weary and heavy laden under this Indiſpoſition?</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:106979:71"/>
            <p> Let Conſcience in the firſt place be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Is there not ſome great Guilt lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctracted? ſome Sin you have not repented of, whereby you have griev'd the Holy Spirit of Chriſt, and this ſtops your Mouths in Prayer, and ſhames your Faces? Or, have you not reſted too much in the Outward Performance of Duty, and Attendance on the Ordinances of the Goſpel? You come to the Table of the Lord, look upon it, it may be, as a Charm, (as too many make it on a Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed) you expect it ſhall work like Phyſick, in a Natural, not in a Moral Way: And by meer Coming, (whatever you have been, or done before, or however negligent you have been in your Preparatory Work,) you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that it ſhould be all one with you. If you can charge your ſelves with any thing of this, you muſt renew your Repentance.</p>
            <p>If Conſcience doth not accuſe you in this Matter; Conſider, God's Thoughts are not as yours. He knows what is from the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fleſh, and what from the Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Spirit. He knows what Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſtraction may ariſe from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of the Body, and what is the Sin of the Soul.</p>
            <p>If upon all theſe Accounts, you loſe the Evidence of your Acceptance with God, and fear the worſt: Yet when a Man hath loſt his Acquittance for a Debt paid, 'tis a Comfort to him to conſider, that the Man he deals with
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106979:71"/>is a merciful, good Man, tho' he cannot find his Diſcharge. God is infinitely Gracious, and is ready to reſtore what you complain you have loſt. It was <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. Yea, if thou feareſt thy Grace was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver true, thy Heart never right with God, thy State never good; there is Mercy enough in God to pardon all thy <hi>former</hi> Hypocriſie: If <hi>now</hi> thou return, and ſeek him with thy whole Heart. There are Promiſes of Grace in ſuch a Caſe to be pleaded, that God will give an Heart of Fleſh, give a Spirit of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, put his Fear within thee, and cauſe thee to walk in his Statutes. Therfore do not fruitleſsly bemoan thy ſelf, and ſit down in Deſpondency, but conſult the Word of God, and ſeek to the Throne of Grace with Hope, whatever thy Objections and Temptations be. Whatever you do, take heed of diſhonourable Thoughts of the Grace and Mercy of God, and of the Security he hath given to perform eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word of Promiſe, wherein he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to hope.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, Since we are ſo near the End of this Year, and many deſign and hope to renew their Covenant the next Lord's-day at his Table, I beg you to conſider, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it for your Encouragement; that <hi>God's Thoughts are not as yours.</hi> Whatever Sins you have been guilty of the laſt Year; whatever you can charge your ſelves with, as
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106979:72"/>to Unworthy Receiving the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> for the time paſt; yet if <hi>now</hi> you will ſeriouſly Examine your ſelves, and humble your Souls, and return to the Lord, and apply to Chriſt, and ſtir up your ſelves, to be diſpos'd as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Believers, to renew your Covenant-Vow and Engagement to be the Lord's, <hi>this next time,</hi> he will forgive the Sins of all your <hi>former Sacraments;</hi> all the Sins of <hi>the laſt Year,</hi> and of <hi>your paſt Lives;</hi> and Seal to you the Forgiveneſs of all Sin, through the Blood of Jeſus. You need not, you ought not to doubt it, for, <hi>As high as the Heavens are above the Earth, ſo are God's Thoughts of Mercy above ours, and his Ways above ours.</hi>

            <p>THE Diſparity between the Thoughts and Ways of God, and Ours here mention'd, hath ſpecial Reference to the Diſpenſation of his Grace and Mercy, in Pardoning the Worſt of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who forſake their Evil Ways, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, by unfeigned Repentance: But in this Diſcourſe, I Deſign to Conſider theſe Words in a larger and more General Senſe,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:106979:73"/>and ſhow, that <hi>The Ways of God are not as Ours, but as far above 'em, as Heaven is above the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Ways of God we may either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe he would direct us to Walk in; what he would have us to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and Do. Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> His Ways and Works towards us, in the Conduct and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Things by his Providence. In the Firſt Senſe we read of the <hi>Way of Truth,</hi> the <hi>Way of his Commandments;</hi> and of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>the Way of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. that is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving as true, the Doctrines he hath Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and Obſerving the Orders, and Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commands which he hath given us. In the latter Senſe, by <hi>the Ways of God,</hi> I Mean, his <hi>Works of Providence,</hi> according to his Word. In both theſe, in the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Word, as to what we are to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and Do; and in the Works of his Providence, what he doth with us, there are many things <hi>far above us.</hi> His Ways are not as Ours, as to Either.</p>
            <p>BOTH may here be very well Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. The <hi>Revelations</hi> of the Will of God by his Word, as to <hi>Faith, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:</hi> And alſo his <hi>Providences,</hi> and Dealings with the Children of Men, according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Revelation. <hi>Our Ways</hi> are not <hi>as His,</hi> as to either. There is a vaſt <hi>Diſparity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. In this Senſe, His Ways are very unlike to Ours, and tranſcendently above them; both as to Matters of <hi>Revelation</hi> and <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:106979:73"/> I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> In what Senſe are God's Ways not like Ours, but vaſtly Different?</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEY are <hi>Different</hi> as to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of 'em. All his Ways and Works are <hi>Perfect;</hi> done with Infinite Wiſdom and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And therfore when <hi>Moſes</hi> publiſhes the Name of God, he begins with this, <hi>Deut.</hi> XXXI. 4. <hi>He is a Rock, His Work is perfect, all his Ways are Judgment:</hi> They are the Fruit of Infinite, Unerring Councel. But what Weakneſs and Imperfection, what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and Folly do we diſcover in our Ways? All his Ways are <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi> Pſal. CXLV. 17. <hi>He is Holy in all his Ways, and Righteous in all his Works.</hi> But what Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Obliquity is there in ours? All His Ways are Juſt and Equal; He Challengeth all the World to prove the Contrary, in any one Particular: What doth he require of us, but in the ſtricteſt Juſtice is Due? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, how Unequal is our Carriage towards Him, and one another? There is an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Harmony, and Agreement in the Ways of God, as to all the parts of them, connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one with another: His Word is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and abiding, ſteddy and conſiſtent, not <hi>Yea and Nay;</hi> 2 Cor. I. 19, 20. <hi>All his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are Yea and Amen. The Strength of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael is not a Man, that he ſhould lye; nor the Son of Man, that he ſhould repent:</hi> But we are Mutable, and often croſs and contradict our Selves in our Ways: And the Beſt Men
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:106979:74"/>do too often diſcover this Inconſtancy in Principle and Practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE is a further <hi>Difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Ways of God and Ours, in the Methods and Means uſed and taken, and the Manner of his Proceeding, to effect an End. His Way is to make <hi>Weak things confound the Mighty, and things baſe and deſpiſed, and which are not, to bring to Nought things that are,</hi> 1 Cor. I. 27. We cannot do ſo. God would not uſe the Wiſdom and Power of the World for the ſpreading of the Goſpel; but by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching it pleaſed God to bring Men to believe, and make the Doctrine of the Croſs of Chriſt, the Power of God to their Eternal Salvation. The Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he employ'd, and the Methods he uſed, to give Succeſs to the Goſpel, did plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence this.</p>
            <p>AND that Inſtance may ſerve inſtead of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other: Was it not an unlikely Attempt, for a few Mean and Obſcure Perſons, ſuch as Publicans and Fiſher-men, and Tent-makers, without the Improvements of Education, or the Advantages of Learning, Eloquence, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and Converſation in the World; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aſſiſtance of Civil Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or any Conſiderable Intereſt and Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to require all Mankind to believe in one <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom they own was Crucified, that he was alive, and was Lord and King, and muſt be receiv'd and obeyed as <hi>the Chriſt of God.</hi> To
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106979:74"/>tell all the World, that all the eſtabliſh'd Rights and Religion of their ſeveral Countries, muſt be laid aſide, and their wicked Cuſtoms and Courſes forſaken, and this new Religion of <hi>Jeſus</hi> be embrac'd, that requires the Belief and Practice of ſo many things they muſt need account very hard, conſidering the Prejudices and the Luſts of Men. Could they hope that Kingdoms and Empires, Schools and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, would eaſily ſubmit to this Change? that they ſhould be too hard for the Devil, and all the Powers of Darkneſs, by preaching the Doctrine of a Crucified Saviour?</p>
            <p>And yet in the Space of about thirty Years, this new Doctrine and Religion was not only diffuſed thro' the greateſt part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but had reach'd as far as <hi>Parthia</hi> and <hi>India:</hi> Even before the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> as our Lord foretold, <hi>Mat.</hi> XXIV. 14. <hi>This Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be preached in all the World, for a witneſs unto all Nations, and then ſhall the End come.</hi> This Succeſs was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by an <hi>Angel flying thro' the midſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and preaching the Everlaſting Goſpel to every Nation, and Kindred, and Tongue, and People,</hi> Rev. XIV. 6.</p>
            <p>And this was done without Force of Arms, and againſt all Oppoſition imaginable: Their Meſſage was entertain'd, their Doctrine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, and Chriſt believed on in the World. Many thouſands were converted preſently, and many more afterward: Tho' the Meſſengers
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106979:75"/>employed could not be ſure of Succeſs, any further than certain of the Truth of their Doctrine, and of the Divine Preſence and Power to accompany them. But they might be almoſt ſure of enduring Torments, and loſing their Lives for publiſhing ſuch a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and perſiſting in it, in the manner they did. But the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God is glorified, in ſucceeding ſuch Weak Inſtruments to ſuch Excellent Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>IN all the Methods of his Providence we find, that <hi>by weak things he confounds the Mighty, and by Fooliſh things,</hi> (as the World accounts 'em,) <hi>confounds the Wiſe.</hi> There are Inſtances of it in the Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to the Plagues of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But it was more manifeſt in the whole Frame of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and in the Succeſs and Prevalency, of it. He defeated <hi>the Devil</hi>'s Deſign, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd his Empire by ſuch Means, as could never be ſuppoſed by Reaſon to do it. By the Seed of the Woman, whom he had ſeduc'd, by the Son of God in our Fleſh, ſuffering and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, <hi>He</hi> wreſted the Victory out of Satan's Hands, by humbling himſelf to the Death of the Croſs; and ſo by dying, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that had the Power Death.</p>
            <p>THERE are other Inſtances might be given, as where God <hi>ſtrengthens the ſpoyled againſt the ſtrong, He brings down thoſe that dwell on high, the lofty City he layeth it low: He layeth it low even to the ground, he bringeth it even to the duſt: The Foot ſhall tread it down, even the Feet of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106979:75"/>Poor, and the Steps of the Needy,</hi> Iſa. 26.6, 7. <hi>The Stone cut out out of the Mountain without hands, ſhall daſh in pieces great Mountaius,</hi> all the four great Monarchies of the World, <hi>and fill the whole Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HIS Ways are not as ours, in that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prefers <hi>the Younger</hi> before <hi>the Elder,</hi> and gives them the Precedency and Principal Bleſſing. <hi>Abel</hi> was preferr'd before <hi>Cain,</hi> and his Offering accepted. <hi>Abraham</hi> the Younger, choſen to be God's Favourite, before his Elder Brethren. <hi>Jacob</hi> before <hi>Eſau,</hi> and <hi>He</hi> preferr'd <hi>Ephraim</hi> before <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> the Elder Son of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> So it is obſerved by the Spirit of God, of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Children, <hi>Shem</hi> is preferr'd, and called the Brother of <hi>Japhet</hi> the Elder, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.21. And <hi>David,</hi> the Youngeſt Son of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> is choſen to be King, and the Man after God's own Heart. To manifeſt the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Counſels, and the Soveraignty of his Grace and Providence; <hi>Was not Eſau Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob's Brother, yet Jacob have I loved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. HIS Ways and <hi>Ours</hi> differ alſo in this, that he is never fruſtrated or diſappointed in his Work, as to what he deſigns. <hi>He brings the Counſels of Men to nought, and the Devices of the People to none Effect, but the Counſel of the Lord ſhall ſtand,</hi> Pſalm XXXIII. 10, 11. <hi>He ſpeaks the word, and it ſhall ſtand: He confirms the Word of his Servants, and performs the Counſel of his Meſſengers, ſaying to Jeruſalem, be thou inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and to the Cities of Judah, ye ſhall be built;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106979:76"/>that ſaith to the Deep be dry, and I will dry up thy Rivers: He ſaith of</hi> Cyrus, <hi>he is my Shepherd, and ſhall perform all my pleaſure; even ſaying to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>thou ſhalt be built, and to the Temple, thy Foundation ſhall be laid,</hi> Iſa. XLIV. <hi>latter end.</hi> Our Ways are not like his, he will always overcome when he judgeth: He will fulfill all his Pleaſure, and accompliſh all that is in his Heart, which we cannot pretend to do.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Secondly,</hi> GOD's <hi>Ways not only differ from ours, but do Tranſcendently exceed 'em,</hi> are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above them, <hi>as high as the Heavens are above the Earth:</hi> There is an unſearchable Depth in the Ways of God, which we are call'd to adore, but cannot comprehend. We may cry out with the Aopſtle, <hi>O the Depth, both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of God! how unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are his Judgments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi> Rom. XI. <hi>His Judgments are a great Depth,</hi> Pſal. XXXVI. 7. <hi>He is wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in Working. His Wiſdom is unſcarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and his Ways paſt finding out:</hi> Job V. 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> IX. 10. There are many things in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> that tranſcend our Reach: If we will not allow this, but muſt have a particular Reaſon for all that God ſpeaks and doth, before we will believe it: What's this, but to make his Wiſdom <hi>finite</hi> like <hi>ours;</hi> or ours <hi>Infinite</hi> like <hi>His!</hi> On this Account, the great Maſters of Philoſophy in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106979:76"/>former Ages, were the worſt Enemies to the Goſpel of Chriſt; becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented their Doctrines without that Wiſdom, or Demonſtration from Natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which <hi>they</hi> uſed, and therefore <hi>the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> was <hi>Fooliſhneſs</hi> to them.</p>
            <p>'TIS the not owning God's Ways to be above ours, but making our Reaſon the Supream Judge concerning Doctrines ſupernaturally revealed, which is the Spring of the many Errors and Blaſphemies that abound among us at this Day. Whereas we may as well meaſure the Juſtice or Injuſtice of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Works of God, by our Will and Choice: Whether what he doth be Juſt and Good, or not, becauſe 'tis what we like, or do not like; as by our finite Minds compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, whether that <hi>can be true,</hi> which in a Divine Revelation is delivered as a true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. We can no more conceive the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Goodneſs of God in ſome Events of Providence, than his Veracity in ſome Truths revealed. More particularly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to <hi>Scripture Revelation,</hi> what we are to believe. Let's conſider that <hi>God's Ways and Thoughts are Above ours:</hi> And what is therein aſſerted, we muſt receive and credit upon the Authority of a Divine Teſtimony, tho' the Doctrine there laid down, may be ſuch as hath no Foundation in Nature; that is, it could not be known but by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. 'Tis a ſufficient Reaſon for us to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106979:77"/>believe the Doctrine, becauſe we find it in the Holy Scripture; and we have Reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce therein, becauſe the Revelation, that is contain'd in this Book, we have Ground to believe, is from GOD; and ſo infallibly true. If we will own our Baptiſm, and take CHRIST for our Teacher, we muſt receive the Truth of what HE hath revealed upon a <hi>Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;</hi> tho' we cann't comprehend how ſuch a Chriſtian Doctrine may be reconcil'd to our common Notions of things in other Caſes.</p>
            <p>I grant, the Doctrine of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> for Inſtance, carries a very great Difficulty in it, and is more oppoſed, as <hi>Incredible,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible,</hi> than other Principles of Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But this being <hi>Reveal'd from Heaven,</hi> as we affirm, and make an Article of our Faith, if we find it contain'd in the Holy Scriptures, God's Ways being ſo far above ours, will do much to anſwer the Objection of its being <hi>Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF GOD be INCOMPREHENSIBLE, why ſhould any thing he's pleas'd to ſay, ſeem <hi>Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible</hi> to us? Where he has interpos'd by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Sentence, our Reaſon muſt ſubmit, and has no Right to debate the Matter, but ought to approve what God ſpeaks, and ſubſcribe to whatever he writes. The Teſtimony of God, whatever Exceptions our Reaſon can make, ſhould convince our Judgment, and doth oblige our Faith. Is not His Veracity a firm and ſure Foundation for us to relye upon, without
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106979:77"/>the concurrent Teſtimony of Reaſon? Shall we not believe Infinite Wiſdom, and Truth upon his own Word, unleſs what he ſaith be in it ſelf Credible, and ſo may be believed, without his Teſtimony? The more we conſider what God is, the more eaſily ſhall we be perſwaded, that he is equally to be believed, when he affirms what we <hi>cannot underſtand to be true,</hi> as when he declares that, which by the common Principles of our Reaſon we know <hi>is ſo</hi> If we own a Divine Revelation, we can no more Doubt of the one then the other; unleſs a Divine Teſtimony muſt receive its force from the Evidence of our Reaſon. Which is to deſtroy all the Teſtimony of Divine Revelation in Supernatural Truths; where the Evidence of Reaſon fails. What! tho' we cannot give an Account, how it is or can be ſo as we find it in the Scripture, is any thing that God ſays the leſs Credible upon that Account? 'Tis the higheſt Reaſon to believe every thing that God hath ſaid: His Authority hath Strength ſufficient to ſecure my <hi>Faith</hi> againſt all ſuch Objections, as ariſe only from Ignorance, and want of Principles to Judge by, or from the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſibleneſs of the Object.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems plainly the Deſign of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> II. Chap. to obviate the great Objection, that is now brought by <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Socinians, by granting it</hi> to be true, That what we are taught to beleive by the Goſpel is Inconceivable, and above the Reach of Humane Reaſon: That
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106979:78"/>many Doctrines of the Goſpel are ſuch as could neither be diſcovered; nor when they were, could be received, and applauded by the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Part of Mankind. It was <hi>not the Wiſdom of Men, nor of this World, but the Wiſdom of God,</hi> 5th and 6th Verſes: The Apoſtle did not go about to perſwade the World of the Truth of them, in ſuch a Manner, as the Wiſe Men among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> made uſe of, to perſwade the People of their Opinions. But the Goſpel being a Divine Revelation, they endeavoured to prove the Truth of it, <hi>by the Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power;</hi> i. e. by Supernatural Proofs from Ancient Prophecies, by unconteſted Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and ſuch like Teſtimonies of God's own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to be a Revelation from him. So that <hi>their Faith did not ſtand in the Wiſdom</hi> of Men but <hi>in the Power of God:</hi> And therfore we ſhould not be ſtumbled, nor think Strange, if Matters of Divine Revelation ſhould be Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable by meer Reaſon.</p>
            <p>HE let's them know, that even this was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, <hi>Verſe</hi> 19. <hi>for it is written by the Prophet, Eye hath not ſeen nor Ear heard, nor hath it enter'd into the Heart of Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit,</hi> by which Spirit, Chriſt and his Apoſtles made known this Doctrine. And it follows, <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all things; even the deep things of God:</hi> And therefore tho' the Things be ſuch as we never thought of before, and we cannot well conceive, when they are told us,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106979:78"/>yet that is no ſuch Wonder; for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our own Souls cannot be conceiv'd by any Inferior Being; nor our ſecret Thoughts known by any other of our Fellow-Creatures, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. <hi>For what Man knoweth the Things of a Man, but the Spirit of Man within him; and ſo the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> As we cannot know the ſecret Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of other Men, 'till they themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them; ſo the Councils of God concerning our Salvation, which depend meerly upon his own Will, none can know, but the Spirit of God; and by ſome Revelation from that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not by Natural Reaſon. <hi>For the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God;</hi> i. e. is acquainted with all his ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
            <p>THE great Queſtion therfore will be, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Revelation that contains ſuch and ſuch incredible Doctrines be Divine. And accordingly the Apoſtle adds in the next Verſe, that he built <hi>his Faith,</hi> not upon the Philoſophy or Inventions of Men; but upon the Revelation which God hath made. <hi>We have not received the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God; that we may know the things that are freely given us of God.</hi> Theſe Things could never elſe have been known, and therefore it ſhould not offend any, that we do not endeavour to prove theſe Doctrines by Philoſophical Arguments: But by ſuch as are proper to prove them by, <hi>viz,</hi> from <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106979:79"/>Revelation. Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the Words which Man's Wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual:</hi> That is, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of the Old Teſtament with thoſe of the New. And after all he he tells us in the 14th. Verſe, That <hi>the Natural Man,</hi> (who will believe nothing but according to his own preconceived Notions from Natural Reaſon) <hi>He receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, they are Fooliſhneſs to him:</hi> He will not allow that to be divinely revealed, which is above meer natural Reaſon. He conſiders only the Difficulty in the Doctrine it ſelf, how it can be true; not what Reaſon he hath to believe ſuch a Revelation to be from God: And ſo he cannot know them, becauſe they are to be <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned;</hi> that is to be judged of, by the Revelation and Teſtimony of the Holy Spirit; and not by the meer Light of Reaſon: They are to be received upon the Account of <hi>a Divine Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE the whole Tenor of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe ſeems to obviate, or anſwer this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Doctrines of the Goſpel being <hi>Incredible</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nintelligible.</hi> And if we apply it to the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and the <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt,</hi> it will hold good, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Difficulty, <hi>how Three can be one,</hi> or how our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour can be God and Man.</hi> How there is one Divine Nature or Eſſence, common unto Three Perſons, united in Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106979:79"/>Attributes, and yet diſtinguiſh'd from each other, in order and manner of Subſiſtance, and by peculiar Idioms and Relations. Theſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may puzzle our Reaſon to conceive, but ſhould not ſtagger our Faith to believe, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd in the Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>Conſidering <hi>what God is,</hi> and <hi>what We are,</hi> 'tis unreaſonable to reject any Article of Faith, becauſe we cannot fully conceive the Nature, and Manner of its being True. Shall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our Darkneſs with his Incomprehenſible Light? Or equal our Underſtanding with his? Shall we refuſe to believe what he hath declar'd for Truth, unleſs we can reconcile it with our Maxims? What room is there left for <hi>Faith,</hi> at this rate? What Credit is given to Divine Teſtimony, if we believe nothing to be True in Gods Word, except we can Fathom it, and would otherwiſe believe, without his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony?</p>
            <p>IF we conſider the Imperfections of our Underſtandings, both as to the Finite Nature of the Soul, and the Manifold Experience we have of it every Day, we muſt be content to be Ignorant of many Things. What is well known in many Civilized Countries, (as ſome have obſerved to illuſtrate this) may appear very ſtrange to a great Part of the Heathen World. The Fabrick of a Watch; or the mutual Communication of Thoughts by Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, would it may be, be as unconceivable to a Barbarous <hi>Indian,</hi> as the Miſtery of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106979:80"/>is to us; yet the Truth of the Thing doth not depend upon his Conception of it.</p>
            <p>AND how ſhort do the wiſeſt and moſt knowing Men come of the infinite Knowledge of God? Tho' we are certain of the Truth of his Being; how little do we know of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Perfections? How far above our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions is the <hi>Divine Eternity;</hi> How all Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions of Time are ever preſent to him and ſubject to his View; His <hi>ſelf Exiſtence, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity, Omnipreſence and Preſcience</hi> of the moſt contingent Events, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How far above us!</p>
            <p>AND ſince we have not a perfect Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Subject; we muſt hearken to what GOD himſelf ſaith of his own Nature, who knows it beſt. And we ought in Reaſon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether the Doctrine of the <hi>Holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> be contained in that Revelation which we receive, and can prove to be <hi>Divine;</hi> if we find it there, let the Doctrine be never ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible and Unintelligible, GOD is ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, and <hi>his Ways and Thoughts above ours,</hi> that we ought not to reject it upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>As the Heavens are higher than the Earth,</hi> His Wiſdom is as the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the higheſt and top of all Wiſdom; Man's as the <hi>Earth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath which there is no Degree, but that of Hell and Darkneſs, ſo that the Things are two Great and Sublime for us to determine about.</p>
            <p>WERE this duly conſider'd we ſhould find, that we cannot have ſo much Evidence of a Doctrine's being <hi>Falſe,</hi> becauſe 'tis <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable;</hi>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:106979:80"/>as there is Evidence of its being <hi>True,</hi> by being contain'd in Scripture Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As to the Truth of things concerning Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Nature, we may judge by our Reaſon: But where the Object is Infinite, 'tis no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Truth of a Thing, that we cannot comprehend it, unleſs a Contradiction be proved, which there is none here.</p>
            <p>IT hath often been proved that God might juſtly require of us in general, the Belief of what we cannot comprehend; and that they who reject the Miſteries of Chriſtianity, run into greater Difficulties than thoſe, who aſſert them. What is Incomprehenſible as to the Manner, may be a neceſſary Article of Faith, as far as it is Reveal'd.
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Biſhop of <hi>Worſter's</hi> Sermon, on 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> I. 15. Serm. VI. Vol. III. <hi>Octavo,</hi> and <hi>Orig. Sac.</hi> Book II. Chap. VIII. 5, 6, 7.</note> We don't aſſert <hi>Three Gods;</hi> and yet but <hi>One God, Three Perſons</hi> and yet but <hi>One Perſon:</hi> That would be contradictory; but the Scripture ſaith, that theſe Three, <hi>Father, Word,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> are <hi>One God:</hi> And we ought to diſtinguiſh between Numbers, and the Natures of Things. For <hi>Three</hi> to be <hi>One,</hi> is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in Numbers; but whether an infinite Nature can communicate it ſelf to three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Subſiſtances, without ſuch a Diviſion as is among created Beings, muſt not be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by bare Number, but by the abſolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Divine Nature: Which maſt be owned to be above our Comprehenſion.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106979:81"/>Therfore for any to aſſert, that there cannot be a Plurality of Perſons; without a Plurality of Natures; or that there cannot be a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Nature, without an Indentity of Perſons; is to pretend to know more of the Infinite Nature of God, then any modeſt Man ought to pretend to.</p>
            <p>'TIS certain the Objections from <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs</hi> of this Doctrine are not ſo great, as the Evidence we have, that ſuch a Doctrine is contained in the Holy Scriptures; and that that this Scripture is of God.</p>
            <p>And let me add, that to pay Adoration and Divine Worſhip to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (as the Chriſtian Church hath done in all Ages), and to Truſt in him for Pardon and Eternal Life, and yet believe him to be only <hi>a Man,</hi> deſtroys all the Reaſons and Arguments of giving Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to <hi>God only:</hi> For to do this, and not own him to be <hi>Omnipreſent, Omniſcient,</hi> and <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> not own him to be the <hi>True,</hi> and <hi>Eternal God,</hi> is a greater Abſurdity and Contradiction, then all that can be objected againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacred Trinity. While they pay him Divine Honour, they muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as the GOD (whom all the Angels worſhip), and yet at the ſame time they deny him to be ſo: And that, becauſe they cannot conceive, how <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> ſhould be <hi>One God.</hi> But let us remember what GOD is, and what we are; and how <hi>his Ways and Thoughts are above ours.</hi> Let <hi>no Man therfore
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106979:81"/>deceive himſelf. If any Man among you ſeem to be Wiſe in this World, let him be a Fool that he may be Wiſe; for the Things of God knoweth no Man; but the Spirit of God who revealeth them unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> GOD's Ways are above ours, <hi>in the Diſpenſations of his Providence:</hi> 'Twere eaſy to ſhow this, in a Multitude of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. In his ſparing and forbearing us: In reſtraining and preventing us: In keeping and preſerving us, and diſappointing our Enemies: Overuling our Affairs, directing our Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and governing all that befalls us, Good or Evil, Accidental or Premeditated, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all to Wiſe and gracious Purpoſes, beyond our Thoughts.</p>
            <p>With what perfect Wiſdom is every Thing managed in the Government of this World? That even the Wickedneſs of Men is made to ſerve the purpoſes of his Glory? How won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully hath God Honour'd his Mercy, and Power, Holineſs, Juſtice and Truth, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming and ſaving Sinners by Jeſus Chriſt, with greater Advantage, then if our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had continued Innocent.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>Ways are not as Ours,</hi> but above them, in governing the Minds of Men, turning their Hearts, influencing their Counſels, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Thoughts, to bring about and fulfil his Own. <hi>His Ways are above ours,</hi> in make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Uſe of very unlikely Inſtruments, weak Means, yea ſuch as in Appearance are Contrary, to effect his own Purpoſes in the Government
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106979:82"/>of Nations, of particular Families, and Perſons.</p>
            <p>AND the Ways of his Providence on leſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ours. In his diſpoſing Croſſes and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Temptations and Hardſhips unto thoſe he loves beſt, and permitting others to live in Peace and Quiet.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>Ways are not as ours, but above them,</hi> in that the very Falls and Faults, Crimes and Follies of good Men are overul'd for much Good; and great Tranſgreſſions before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, made ſervicable to excellent Purpoſes afterward: What was Poyſon in Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Medicinal by Divine Grace. He that ſtumbles in the way, gets ground by it, if it help him to mend his Pace, to walk faſter, and more warily. <q>How many can ſay, if it had not been for ſuch and ſuch Fails, I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known ſo much of my own VVeakneſs, and Frailty; I had never had ſuch Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Temptation, and how unable of my ſelf to reſiſt it; I ſhould never have had ſo hearty a Deteſtation of Sin; ſuch a Tenderneſs of Conſcience; ſuch an Awe of offending God; ſo fervent a Zeal to pleaſe him; ſo ſweet a Senſe of his Mercy; ſo Thankful an Acknowledgment of his Grace in delivering and recovering me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The very Remainders of Corruption in the Hearts of Men, which they bewail, and pray, and ſtrive againſt, I ſhall ſerve to convince them of their neceſſary Dependance on Gods Grace; ſhall cauſe them to walk humbly with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106979:82"/>God; ſhall make them more circumſpect and watchful againſt Temptation; and raiſe their Eſteem, and Value of the Blood of Chriſt, and his conſtant Interceſſion in Heaven. God hereby aſſiſts us to keep Conſcience tender, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites our Diligence after further Degrees of Mortification, quickens us to preſs on, by growth in Grace, toward Perfection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, HIS <hi>Ways are above Ours</hi> in the Converſion of Sinners, as to <hi>the Subjects</hi> he makes choice of, as to <hi>the Seaſon</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> of their Change; as to <hi>the Means</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> by which it is Accompliſh'd and brought about. The Wind blows were it liſts, and the Holy Spirit (by the Miniſtry oftentimes of weaker Minſters) works powerfully and ſavingly in whom he will, both to will, and do, of his own good Pleaſure. One is awaken'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, prick'd at the Heart by a Sermon. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in the ſame Seat, under the ſame Sermon, feels nothing. Sometimes by a ſoft ſtill Voice, at other times by Thunder. Sometimes the moſt Unlikely are taken, and effectually called; when others are left: And this after many years delay and diſcouragement, and no hopeful Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but the Contrary. Some out of wicked Families converted; others after ſtrict and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Education, become and continue moſt Vile and Profligate. What different Succeſs hath the Goſpel in ſome Places? At ſome Times, and to ſome Perſons? And at different Times in the ſame Place? Tho' the ſame Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:106979:83"/>and the ſame Preacher? Sometimes on the weaker and more ignorant Sort, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the more Learned; ſometimes on elder Perſons, and often on Younger: Who have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd much of the Grace of God betimes, with leſs Advantage of Education than others. And at <hi>the laſt Hour,</hi> ſome Malefactors, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Sentence of Death, 'tis hop'd, have been truly Penitent, and Accepted, as well as the Thief on the Croſs. Some by their own Afflictions, ſome by the warning of other Men's Examples, and byother Means, as well as by the plain Preaching of the Word, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Means.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>Ways alſo are above Ours,</hi> in the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Men in this Life: In making ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which were <hi>not greater Sinners then others,</hi> as our Lord hath expreſly told us, <hi>Luke</hi> XIII. He would not ſpare <hi>Job's Ten Children</hi> upon the Interceſſion and Prayer of their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Father, tho' we don't read that they were wicked; when he would have ſpared ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands, that were wicked, in <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and the Cities of the Plain, if there had been but <hi>Ten Righteous Perſons</hi> among them.</p>
            <p>HIS <hi>Ways are above Ours,</hi> in bringing Good out of the Evil of Puniſhment, and uſing wicked Inſtruments to accompliſh other Ends and Purpoſes, than they deſign'd. The like might be ſaid of Gods Ways in ſaving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his People in extraordinary Dangers: Tarrying till their Enemies are at the very
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106979:83"/>height of their Wickedneſs; and when there is leaſt Proſpect, or Appearance which way Deliverance ſhould come, then to interpoſe by ſeaſonable Salvation</p>

               <p>USE, I.</p>
               <p>NO wonder then if we ſo often miſtake in our Thoughts, and Conceptions of the Ways and Works of God. If they are ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ours, as Heaven is high above the Earth, if they are unſearchable, and beyond our reach, that we can ſee but a little Part of his Ways, do not underſtand the Connection and Dependance of one Part with the other, or the Deſign of the whole. <hi>His Way is in the Whirlwind, the Clouds are the Duſt of his Feet, and his Footſteps are not known: He hideth himſelf that we cannot ſee him. Job</hi> XXXIII. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Nah.</hi> I. 3.</p>
               <p>AS to his Ways of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> I have largely ſhown in the foregoing Sermons, That he is more Gracious then we believe: He is able to do, he doth, and will do more then we are able to ask or think, <hi>Eph.</hi> III. 20. We think (it may be) he will never receive us after ſuch and ſuch Tranſgreſſions, and yet he doth. We thought he would never Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, and yet he hath forgiven: We ſaid in our Deſpair, that he is gone, and will never
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106979:84"/>Return; and yet the Light breaks out again, and we have found it to our Comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> ARE his Ways ſo much above Ours, <hi>what Reaſon have we to Reverence and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore God in all his Ways and Works.</hi> Believing his Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Truth, we glorify God: By crediting his Word, truſting his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and following his Counſel, and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Providence: Tho' the Doctrine be very miſterious, the Providence very dark, the Duty very Difficult, and what is promiſed a great way off, and to Sence unlikely.</p>
               <p>The more we contemplate the Wonders of his Providence and Grace, the higher Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall we have for Him; and Abaſe our Selves before his Glorious Majeſty; if we ſpeak of Strength, he is Strong; if of Goodneſs, he is Love; if of Wiſdom, he is Wiſe, <hi>the only Wiſe God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis unreaſonable then to object againſt this Providence, becauſe we cannot comprehend the Wiſdom and Juſtice of every Event: We may object our Selves into Atheiſm, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, if we will not adore his unſearchable Wiſdom in the Government of the World. <hi>His Judgments are a great Deep, Pſal.</hi> XXXVI. 6. 'Tis in vain for us to pretend to go to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of them, when he himſelf hath declared that they are <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſearchable.</hi> We ſhould rather admire <hi>God;</hi> and confeſs our own Ignorance when the great Apoſtle himſelf declares, that <hi>Gods Ways are paſt our finding out. Rom.</hi> XI. 33.</p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:106979:84"/>
               <p> VVe may be certain that all he doth is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to infinite VViſdom and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. As long as we own him to be God, we are ſure he will do nothing Repugnant to thoſe Perfections.</p>
               <p>BESIDES he hath appointed a Day, wherein he will ſatisfy all the VVorld by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Righteous Judgment. In the mean time, <hi>He doth great Things paſt our finding out; and wonderful Things without Number.</hi> XI. <hi>Job.</hi> 10. There are Depths and Miſteries in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, that we muſt acknowledg to be Unſearchable: Let us not then Cenſure what we cannot Underſtand, what we cannot Fathom. Is it ſtrange, that incomprehenſible VViſdom ſhould do incomprehenſible Things? VVe ſhould not therfore enquire too curiouſly into the Secrets of his Providence, nor deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing,
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>J. Barrow,</hi> of the Unſearchableneſs of God's Judgments. <hi>Rom.</hi> XI. 33. Vol. III. Serm 23.</note> Raſhly concerningit, which is not revealed to us.</p>
               <p>VVE are well aſſur'd, that he made the VVorld; and yet there are many Queſtions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the VVorks of <hi>Creation</hi> that may puzzle the wiſeſt and moſt diligent Enquirer. So in <hi>the Government of the World,</hi> there are many things above our reach, and yet we may be aſſured an unerring VViſdom governs all. VVe are ſo Ignorant and ſhort Sighted; and the Deſigns of God are ſo far beyond us, and the Means he uſeth are oftentimes ſo Various,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106979:85"/>and their Connection with his Deſign ſo much concealed from our weak Eyes, that no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if we are often at a loſs; eſpecially when all the Particulars of his VVorks of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that make up the Beauty of the whole, are wonderfully interwoven together (one Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage and one Action having a certain Reference to a Million of others, yea unto all others, from firſt to laſt) ſo that it is not ſtrange, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend not the Reaſons of all Events; and diſcern not the Wiſdom and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, as to many Particulars, while yet we believe him to be Wiſe, and Holy in all his Ways, and Righteous in all his Works.</p>
               <p>HEREAFTER, when he hath finiſh'd his whole Deſign, from the Beginning to the End, (whereof we <hi>now</hi> ſee but a ſmall Part), the Difficulties that perplex and ſhock us for the preſent, will be all ſolv'd. VVhat is now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Darkneſs ſhall appear in open Light: And what is now a Riddle, will ceaſe to be ſo: For all the Changes and Revolutions of the VVorld, Publick and Private, as to Nations, Families and Perſons, will all be found, to have been directed in the wiſeſt and beſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and to have been <hi>one compleat and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Means,</hi> to bring about his VViſe and Holy Counſelfor his own Glory.</p>
               <p>LET us therefore adore him, conſidering that <hi>his Ways are above Ours,</hi> for if we do not <hi>now,</hi> ſee a Reaſon for the Truth of all that God
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106979:85"/>ſpeaks, or the Wiſdom of all that he doth, we may yet be aſſur'd, that GOD is <hi>True,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Good.</hi> And we ought to lay our hands on our Mouths, and Acquieſce, for this very Reaſon, becauſe his Ways are ſo much <hi>above ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> WHAT Reaſon <hi>then</hi> have we, to put our Truſt and Confidence in God? To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what he promiſeth, and leave it to him, to fulfil his Word in his own Time and Way? His Ways are ſo muth above Ours, that when we think him <hi>furtheſt</hi> off, he may be <hi>neareſt</hi> the doing that for us, which we deſire. If God ſhould not chuſe our Condition for us, we ſhould eaſily be undone by our own Choice. But we may and ought to truſt Him, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what is always, and upon all Accounts, <hi>Beſt for us.</hi> VVhereas there is no Man of the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Foreſight, and of the greateſt Warineſs, but may eaſily be deceived and Miſtaken, as to what is good for him in this Life. VVe find this was the Reſult of the Wiſe Man's Thoughts, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Affairs of this World. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> VI. 11, 12. <hi>Seeing there be many Things that increaſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, what is Man the better? For who knoweth what is Good for Man in this Life; all the days of his vain Life, which he ſpendeth as a ſhadow? For who can tell a Man, what ſhall be after him, under the Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:106979:86"/>
               <p> WE often deſire and chuſe ſuch a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good, as proper to ſerve and promote ſome Particular Intereſt and Deſign, but cannot tell, whether it will be Prejudicial to our <hi>main</hi> and <hi>greateſt Intereſt:</hi> If it would be ſo, 'tis a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be diſappointed. Beſides we are too apt to conſider our ſelves, as <hi>Single</hi> and <hi>Alone,</hi> in a private Capacity: God only knows what is beſt for us, as we are Parts of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, Members of the Univerſe, and ſtand related to other Men: It may be, we would deſire to have, and be, and do <hi>that,</hi> which is more for the publick Good, ſhould be enjoy'd by <hi>Others,</hi> and done by <hi>Others.</hi> Such a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Life, ſuch a Place of Imployment, ſuch a Station of Service, we reckon to be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;</hi> when perhaps God knows, that <hi>We</hi> ſhall do more good in <hi>another;</hi> and that ſome Other will be more uſeful, and more a publick Bleſſing in <hi>that Poſt.</hi> Accordingly we ſhould leave it to his Providence, who appoints us our VVork, to Aſſign us our Station, and Opportunity for it.</p>
               <p>AND here 'tis moſt certain, <hi>our Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eternal Good</hi> is greatly concern'd. It may be, what we wiſh for, as a Deſireable, temporal Bleſſing, would be to our Prejudice and Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, as to the VVelfare of <hi>our Souls.</hi> How many, on this Account, have ſeen Reaſon to be thankful for Afflictive Diſappiontments, as to many things they endeavour'd, and deſir'd, but
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106979:86"/>God order'd it otherwiſe, for their beſt Good. <hi>No Affliction for the preſent is Joyous,</hi> but <hi>Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, but afterwards it produceth the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Heb. XII. 11. Uninterrupted Health and Peace, Plenty, Reputation, Joy and Comfort in Relations, may be deny'd us in Faithfulneſs and Kindneſs: For God only knows, whether it would not interfere with our <hi>Spiritual Good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TIS an obvious, and daily Inſtance as to <hi>Riches,</hi> and the Increaſe of an <hi>Eſtate:</hi> Many a poor Man (or ſuppoſe one in a middle Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,) He fancies, if he had a great Eſtate, what a great Deal of Good he would do: VVith what a large Heart, he would ſupply the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the Poor; How many generous and charitable Things he would undertake: He would fain Help and Relieve the Poor (he tells you if he could,) and therfore his Deſire of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and Diligence in ſeeking for them, is but that he may do Good: But when <hi>this Man</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, how Common is it, that his Heart and Purpoſes are chang'd with his Condition? Or his Deſire, and Love of Mony, grows with his Eſtate; ſo that He is as unable to do the Good he deſires to do, as before. The Poor is unreliev'd, and he thinks himſelf, as far from an Ability to Relieve them <hi>now;</hi> as when he had but <hi>half</hi> of that, which now he hath. Beſides that he is tempted to forget God, in other Inſtances; and falls into Luxury and Vanity, Intemperance, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106979:87"/>Pride; and Conſequently, it had been better for him, to have continu'd in a Lower Station. He is really a Loſer by his Gain of Riches, and 'tis well, if He be not finally and for ever loſt.</p>
               <p>IT is therfore our <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> as well as <hi>Duty,</hi> for us to leave all Events to GOD, whoſe VVays are ſo far above ours. If we Reflect upon our own Ignorance, as to what ſhall be on the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: How eaſily may to Morrows Event, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel our Scheme of Thoughts, and fruſtrate the moſt probable Deſigns that can be laid? And how Ignorant are we, of what the Train of Conſequences may be, upon what we De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Unleſs we know, what will follow upon it, we cannot tell whether it will prove a Miſchief, or a Bleſſing. <hi>You thought Evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me,</hi> ſays <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his Brethren, when they ſold him into <hi>Egypt, but God meant it for Good, to bring it to paſs (as at this Day) to ſave much People alive,</hi> Gen. L. 20.</p>
               <p>MANY have lamented with Impatience, that they came too late to ſuch a Port, to Sail with ſuch a Convoy, or to Imbark in ſuch a Ship; and yet within a little while, have bleſt God for the Diſappointment; having heard that the Ship was caſt away, or taken by an Enemy; and all the Paſſengers drown'd or made Priſoners. VVheras GOD knows all the Conſequences of Things; having all Cauſes and Effects in View; and all the Links of the Chain in his own Hand; and therfore
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106979:87"/>can never be Miſtaken in <hi>what is Beſt.</hi> Let us therefore truſt him, to diſpoſe of Us and ours, according to his own good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> HOVV Reprovable then is it, to Limit and Preſcribe to God, or to Cenſure, him concerning his VVays and VVorks, which are ſo much above us? He is not bound to give us an Account of all his Matters, or to utter all his VVords, for the Satisfaction of our curious and proud Enquiries. VVe are not to direct him what to do, as if we would teach him Knowledge: As if he had not done every thing for the beſt, in what befalls us, or Others. <hi>Shall he that contends with the Almighty inſtruct him? he that reproveth GOD let him anſwer it.</hi> Job XI. 2. with this <hi>Elihu</hi> ſilenc'd <hi>Job,</hi> XXXIII. 12.13. <hi>Behold in this thou art not Juſt, I will anſwer thee. God is greater then Man,</hi> That is, <hi>His ways are above ours.</hi> Let us take heed of Cenſuring his Infinite and Eternal Wiſdom. For we are but of yeſter day, and know nothing. We cannot ſearch his ſecret Counſells. <hi>Job</hi> XI. 6. <hi>It is as high as Heaven, what canſt thou do? Deeper then Hell, what eanſt thou know?</hi> His kind De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, or faithful Gracious Purpoſes, may be concealed from us; as our Lord told <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> XIII. 7. <hi>What I do, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not now; but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:106979:88"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> LABOUR to ſubmit to God in all his Ways, without Murmuring, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining. 'Tis both our <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> to do this, from what hath been diſcours'd. The Mind of God revealed in <hi>his Word;</hi> and the Will of God declar'd in <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> muſt both be ſubmitted to, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Objections we may have concerning <hi>Either.</hi> As to <hi>the latter,</hi> we know not what is fitteſt to deſire, or chuſe for our Selves, or Others. We often ask <hi>that,</hi> which God knows would be Hurtful; and are Diſatisfied with <hi>that,</hi> which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for our Good. We would chuſe <hi>that,</hi> which it may be, would be Injurious to God, to our Selves; and to the World: And as often Repine at <hi>that,</hi> as a Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which God intends us, as a Benefit; and afterwards proves ſo. Let us not then complain of his Government, or repine at his Providence. Let us not preſume to demand a Reaſon, why ſuch a Croſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls us; or why we are depriv'd of ſuch a Comfort: Let us not dare Arraign his Wiſdom, and Soveraignty at our Bar; but patiently ſubmit to him, and wait for him, <hi>He is a God of Judgment; and his Thoughts and Ways are above ours.</hi> Therfore.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:106979:88"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> TAKE Comfort from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. He may, and can turn all for Good, that we deprecate, or complain of as Evil. He may be bringing about <hi>That,</hi> which we have long pray'd for, by thoſe very Means, which have a quite contrary Appearance, for the preſent. He hath a thouſand Methods, that we can't conceive of, to effect his own Purpoſes; and he knows the fitteſt Time.</p>
               <p>WHATEVER Difficulties we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; Whatever Burdens we feel; What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Temptations we meet with; VVhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Diſappointments we have had, or may have; VVhatever inward or outward Diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we may be exercis'd with; Still remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>Gods Ways are far above ours.</hi> Tho' he ſeem to neglect us, or to hide himſelf from us; tho' he ſeem to ſhut out our Prayers; and not regard our Cry; yet he knows what to do, and when to do it, and in the beſt Manner: And hath promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>all things ſhall work for our Good;</hi> and that <hi>he will never leave us, nor forſake us.</hi> Therfore Reſign your Selves to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving intirely to follow him; tho' like <hi>Abraham,</hi> you know not whither he will lead you. Reſolve you will ſubmit your Underſtandings and VVills to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve whatever he declares to be True; and approve whatever he Appoints; and bear
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106979:89"/>whatſoever he impoſeth; and undertake, and do, all that he requires; and patiently wait on the Lord, and keep his VVays, <hi>who is a God of Judgment.</hi> You have ſufficient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to hope in his Mercy, and truſt Him to fulfil his VVord, in his own Method, becauſe <hi>his Ways and Thoughts are not as Ours.</hi>
